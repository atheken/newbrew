No release binaries for FreeBSD provided as of yet.\n\nAgain a big thanks to [@joske](https://github.com/joske) for his porting efforts!\n\nSince compatibility with Linux, macOS and FreeBSD are done, the focus going forward will be on new features like GPU monitoring.\n\n##### 13 November 2021\n\nRelease v1.1.0 with macOS support. Binaries in [continuous-build-macos](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/actions/workflows/continuous-build-macos.yml) are only x86 for now.\nmacOS binaries + installer are included for both x86 and ARM64 (Apple Silicon) in the releases.\n\nBig thank you to [@joske](https://github.com/joske) who wrote the vast majority of the implementation!\n\n<details>\n<summary>More...</summary>\n\n##### 30 October 2021\n\nWork on the OSX [macOS] and FreeBSD branches, both initiated and mostly worked on by [@joske](https://github.com/joske), will likely be completed in the coming weeks.\nThe OSX [macOS] branch has some memory leaks that needs to be sorted out and both have some issues with the processes cpu usage calculation and other smaller issues that needs fixing.\n\nIf you want to help out, test for bugs/fix bugs or just try out the branches:\n\n**macOS / OSX**\n```bash\n# Install and use Homebrew or MacPorts package managers for easy dependency installation\nbrew install coreutils make gcc@11\ngit clone https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git\ncd btop\ngit checkout OSX\ngmake\n```\n\n**FreeBSD**\n```bash\nsudo pkg install gmake gcc11 coreutils git\ngit clone https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git\ncd btop\ngit checkout freebsd\ngmake\n```\n\nNote that GNU make (`gmake`) is recommended but not required for macOS/OSX but it is required on FreeBSD.\n\n\n##### 6 October 2021\n\nmacOS development have been started by [@joske](https://github.com/joske), big thanks :)\nSee branch [OSX](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/tree/OSX) for current progress.\n\n##### 18 September 2021\n\nThe Linux version of btop++ is complete. Released as version 1.0.0\n\nI will be providing statically compiled binaries for a range of architectures in every release for those having problems compiling.\n\nFor compilation GCC 10 is required, GCC 11 preferred.\n\nPlease report any bugs to the [Issues](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/issues/new?assignees=aristocratos&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D) page.\n\nThe development plan right now:\n\n* 1.1.0 macOS [OSX] support\n* 1.2.0 FreeBSD support\n* 1.3.0 Support for GPU monitoring\n* 1.X.0 Other platforms and features...\n\nWindows support is not in the plans as of now, but if anyone else wants to take it on, I will try to help.\n\n##### 5 May 2021\n\nThis project is gonna take some time until it has complete feature parity with bpytop, since all system information gathering will have to be written from scratch without any external libraries.\nAnd will need some help in the form of code contributions to get complete support for BSD and macOS/OSX.\n\n</details>\n\n## Documents\n\n**[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**\n\n**[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**\n\n**[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**\n\n## Description\n\nResource monitor that shows usage and stats for processor, memory, disks, network and processes.\n\nC++ version and continuation of [bashtop](https://github.com/aristocratos/bashtop) and [bpytop](https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop).\n\n## Features\n\n* Easy to use, with a game inspired menu system.\n* Full mouse support, all buttons with a highlighted key is clickable and mouse scroll works in process list and menu boxes.\n* Fast and responsive UI with UP, DOWN keys process selection.\n* Function for showing detailed stats for selected process.\n* Ability to filter processes.\n* Easy switching between sorting options.\n* Tree view of processes.\n* Send any signal to selected process.\n* UI menu for changing all config file options.\n* Auto scaling graph for network usage.\n* Shows IO activity and speeds for disks.\n* Battery meter\n* Selectable symbols for the graphs.\n* Custom presets\n* And more...\n\n## Themes\n\nBtop++ uses the same theme files as bpytop and bashtop (some color values missing in bashtop themes) .\n\nSee [themes](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/tree/main/themes) folder for available themes.\n\nThe `make install` command places the default themes in `[$PREFIX or /usr/local]/share/btop/themes`.\nUser created themes should be placed in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/btop/themes` or `$HOME/.config/btop/themes`.\n\nLet me know if you want to contribute with new themes.\n\n## Support and funding\n\nYou can sponsor this project through github, see [my sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/aristocratos) for options.\n\nOr donate through [paypal](https://paypal.me/aristocratos) or [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/aristocratos).\n\nAny support is greatly appreciated!\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nFor best experience, a terminal with support for:\n\n* 24-bit truecolor ([See list of terminals with truecolor support](https://github.com//termstandard/colors))\n* 256-color terminals are supported through 24-bit to 256-color conversion when setting \"truecolor\" to False in the options or with \"-lc/--low-color\" arguments.\n* 16 color TTY mode will be activated if a real tty device is detected. Can be forced with \"-t/--tty_on\" arguments.\n* Wide characters (Are sometimes problematic in web-based terminals)\n\nAlso needs a UTF8 locale and a font that covers:\n\n* Unicode Block “Braille Patterns” U+2800 - U+28FF (Not needed in TTY mode or with graphs set to type: block or tty.)\n* Unicode Block “Geometric Shapes” U+25A0 - U+25FF\n* Unicode Block \"Box Drawing\" and \"Block Elements\" U+2500 - U+259F\n\n### **Notice (Text rendering issues)**\n\n* If you are having problems with the characters in the graphs not looking like they do in the screenshots, it's likely a problem with your systems configured fallback font not having support for braille characters.\n\n* See [Terminess Powerline](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Terminus/terminus-ttf-4.40.1) for an example of a font that includes the braille symbols.\n\n* See comments by @sgleizes [link](https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop/issues/100#issuecomment-684036827) and @XenHat [link](https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop/issues/100#issuecomment-691585587) in issue #100 for possible solutions.\n\n* If text are misaligned and you are using Konsole or Yakuake, turning off \"Bi-Directional text rendering\" is a possible fix.\n\n* Characters clipping in to each other or text/border misalignments is not bugs caused by btop, but most likely a fontconfig or terminal problem where the braille characters making up the graphs aren't rendered correctly.\n\n* Look to the creators of the terminal emulator you use to fix these issues if the previous mentioned fixes don't work for you.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n#### Main UI showing details for a selected process\n\n![Screenshot 1](Img/normal.png)\n\n#### Main UI in TTY mode\n\n![Screenshot 2](Img/tty.png)\n\n#### Main UI with custom options\n\n![Screenshot 3](Img/alt.png)\n\n#### Main-menu\n\n![Screenshot 3](Img/main-menu.png)\n\n#### Options-menu\n\n![Screenshot 4](Img/options-menu.png)\n\n#### Help-menu\n\n![Screenshot 5](Img/help-menu.png)\n\n## Installation\n\n**Binaries for Linux are statically compiled with musl and works on kernel 2.6.39 and newer**\n\n1. **Download btop-(VERSION)-(ARCH)-(PLATFORM).tbz from [latest release](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/releases/latest) and unpack to a new folder**\n\n   **Notice! Use x86_64 for 64-bit x86 systems, i486 and i686 are 32-bit!**\n\n2. **Install (from created folder)**\n\n   * **Run install.sh or:**\n\n   ```bash\n   # use \"make install PREFIX=/target/dir\" to set target, default: /usr/local\n   # only use \"sudo\" when installing to a NON user owned directory\n   sudo make install\n   ```\n\n3. **(Optional) Set suid bit to make btop always run as root (or other user)**\n\n   Enables signal sending to any process without starting with `sudo` and can prevent /proc read permissions problems on some systems.\n\n   * **Run setuid.sh or:**\n\n   ```bash\n   # run after make install and use same PREFIX if any was used at install\n   # set SU_USER and SU_GROUP to select user and group, default is root:root\n   sudo make setuid\n   ```\n\n* **Uninstall**\n\n  * **Run uninstall.sh or:**\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo make uninstall\n   ```\n\n* **Show help**\n\n   ```bash\n   make help\n   ```\n\n**Binary release (from native os repo)**\n\n* **openSUSE**\n  * **Tumbleweed:**\n    ```bash\n    sudo zypper in btop\n    ```\n  * For all other versions, see [openSUSE Software: btop](https://software.opensuse.org/package/btop)\n* **Fedora**\n    ```bash\n    sudo dnf install btop\n\t```\n* **RHEL/AlmaLinux 8+**\n    ```bash\n    sudo dnf install epel-release\n\tsudo dnf install btop\n\t```\n* **FreeBSD**\n\t```sh\n\tpkg install btop\n\t```\n\n\n**Binary release on Homebrew (macOS (x86_64 & ARM64) / Linux (x86_64))**\n\n* **[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/btop)**\n  ```bash\n  brew install btop\n  ```\n\n## Compilation Linux\n\n   Needs GCC 10 or higher, (GCC 11 or above strongly recommended for better CPU efficiency in the compiled binary).\n\n   The makefile also needs GNU coreutils and `sed` (should already be installed on any modern distribution).\n\n   For a `cmake` based build alternative see the [fork](https://github.com/jan-guenter/btop/tree/main) by @jan-guenter\n\n1. **Install dependencies (example for Ubuntu 21.04 Hirsute)**\n\n   Use gcc-10 g++-10 if gcc-11 isn't available\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt install coreutils sed git build-essential gcc-11 g++-11\n   ```\n\n2. **Clone repository**\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git\n   cd btop\n   ```\n\n3. **Compile**\n\n   Append `VERBOSE=true` to display full compiler/linker commands.\n\n   Append `STATIC=true` for static compilation.\n\n   Notice! If using LDAP Authentication, usernames will show as UID number for LDAP users if compiling statically with glibc.\n\n   Append `QUIET=true` for less verbose output.\n\n   Append `STRIP=true` to force stripping of debug symbols (adds `-s` linker flag).\n\n   Append `ARCH=<architecture>` to manually set the target architecture.\n   If omitted the makefile uses the machine triple (output of `-dumpmachine` compiler parameter) to detect the target system.\n\n   Use `ADDFLAGS` variable for appending flags to both compiler and linker.\n\n   For example: `ADDFLAGS=-march=native` might give a performance boost if compiling only for your own system.\n\n   If `g++` is linked to an older version of gcc on your system specify the correct version by appending `CXX=g++-10` or `CXX=g++-11`.\n\n   ```bash\n   make\n   ```\n\n4. **Install**\n\n   Append `PREFIX=/target/dir` to set target, default: `/usr/local`\n\n   Notice! Only use \"sudo\" when installing to a NON user owned directory.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo make install\n   ```\n\n5. **(Optional) Set suid bit to make btop always run as root (or other user)**\n\n   No need for `sudo` to enable signal sending to any process and to prevent /proc read permissions problems on some systems.\n\n   Run after make install and use same PREFIX if any was used at install.\n\n   Set `SU_USER` and `SU_GROUP` to select user and group, default is `root` and `root`\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo make setuid\n   ```\n\n* **Uninstall**\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo make uninstall\n   ```\n\n* **Remove any object files from source dir**\n\n   ```bash\n   make clean\n   ```\n\n* **Remove all object files, binaries and created directories in source dir**\n\n   ```bash\n   make distclean\n   ```\n\n* **Show help**\n\n   ```bash\n   make help\n   ```\n\n## Compilation macOS OSX\n\n   Needs GCC 10 or higher, (GCC 11 or above strongly recommended for better CPU efficiency in the compiled binary).\n\n   GCC 12 needed for macOS Ventura. If you get linker errors on Ventura you'll need to upgrade your command line tools (Version 14.0) is bugged.\n\n   The makefile also needs GNU coreutils and `sed`.\n\n   Install and use Homebrew or MacPorts package managers for easy dependency installation\n\n1. **Install dependencies (example for Homebrew)**\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install coreutils make gcc@12\n   ```\n\n2. **Clone repository**\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git\n   cd btop\n   ```\n\n3. **Compile**\n\n   Append `VERBOSE=true` to display full compiler/linker commands.\n\n   Append `STATIC=true` for static compilation (only libgcc and libstdc++ will be static!).\n\n   Append `QUIET=true` for less verbose output.\n\n   Append `STRIP=true` to force stripping of debug symbols (adds `-s` linker flag).\n\n   Append `ARCH=<architecture>` to manually set the target architecture.\n   If omitted the makefile uses the machine triple (output of `-dumpmachine` compiler parameter) to detect the target system.\n\n   Use `ADDFLAGS` variable for appending flags to both compiler and linker.\n\n   For example: `ADDFLAGS=-march=native` might give a performance boost if compiling only for your own system.\n\n   ```bash\n   gmake\n   ```\n\n4. **Install**\n\n   Append `PREFIX=/target/dir` to set target, default: `/usr/local`\n\n   Notice! Only use \"sudo\" when installing to a NON user owned directory.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo gmake install\n   ```\n\n5. **(Recommended) Set suid bit to make btop always run as root (or other user)**\n\n   No need for `sudo` to see information for non user owned processes and to enable signal sending to any process.\n\n   Run after make install and use same PREFIX if any was used at install.\n\n   Set `SU_USER` and `SU_GROUP` to select user and group, default is `root` and `wheel`\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo gmake setuid\n   ```\n\n* **Uninstall**\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo gmake uninstall\n   ```\n\n* **Remove any object files from source dir**\n\n   ```bash\n   gmake clean\n   ```\n\n* **Remove all object files, binaries and created directories in source dir**\n\n   ```bash\n   gmake distclean\n   ```\n\n* **Show help**\n\n   ```bash\n   gmake help\n   ```\n\n## Compilation FreeBSD\n\n   Needs GCC 10 or higher, (GCC 11 or above strongly recommended for better CPU efficiency in the compiled binary).\n\n   Note that GNU make (`gmake`) is required to compile on FreeBSD.\n\n1. **Install dependencies**\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo pkg install gmake gcc11 coreutils git\n   ```\n\n2. **Clone repository**\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git\n   cd btop\n   ```\n\n3. **Compile**\n\n   Append `VERBOSE=true` to display full compiler/linker commands.\n\n   Append `STATIC=true` for static compilation (only libgcc and libstdc++ will be static!).\n\n   Append `QUIET=true` for less verbose output.\n\n   Append `STRIP=true` to force stripping of debug symbols (adds `-s` linker flag).\n\n   Append `ARCH=<architecture>` to manually set the target architecture.\n   If omitted the makefile uses the machine triple (output of `-dumpmachine` compiler parameter) to detect the target system.\n\n   Use `ADDFLAGS` variable for appending flags to both compiler and linker.\n\n   For example: `ADDFLAGS=-march=native` might give a performance boost if compiling only for your own system.\n\n   ```bash\n   gmake\n   ```\n\n4. **Install**\n\n   Append `PREFIX=/target/dir` to set target, default: `/usr/local`\n\n   Notice! Only use \"sudo\" when installing to a NON user owned directory.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo gmake install\n   ```\n\n5. **(Recommended) Set suid bit to make btop always run as root (or other user)**\n\n   No need for `sudo` to see information for non user owned processes and to enable signal sending to any process.\n\n   Run after make install and use same PREFIX if any was used at install.\n\n   Set `SU_USER` and `SU_GROUP` to select user and group, default is `root` and `wheel`\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo gmake setuid\n   ```\n\n* **Uninstall**\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo gmake uninstall\n   ```\n\n* **Remove any object files from source dir**\n\n   ```bash\n   gmake clean\n   ```\n\n* **Remove all object files, binaries and created directories in source dir**\n\n   ```bash\n   gmake distclean\n   ```\n\n* **Show help**\n\n   ```bash\n   gmake help\n   ```\n\n## Installing the snap\n[![btop](https://snapcraft.io/btop/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/btop)\n\n### Note: there are now two snaps available: `btop` and `btop-desktop`. The desktop version is much larger and includes the desktop entries needed to allow for launching `btop` with a click.\n\n * **Install the snap**\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo snap install btop\n    or\n    sudo snap install btop-desktop\n    ```\n * **Install the latest snap from the edge channel**\n   ```\n   sudo snap install btop --edge\n   or\n   sudo snap install btop-desktop --edge\n   ```\n\n * **Connect the interface**\n\n    ```bash\n\tsudo snap connect btop:removable-media\n\tor\n\tsudo snap connect btop-desktop:removable-media\n\t```\n\n\n## Configurability\n\nAll options changeable from within UI.\nConfig and log files stored in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/btop` or `$HOME/.config/btop` folder\n\n#### btop.conf: (auto generated if not found)\n\n```bash\n#?
