  "readme": "# Mailpit - email testing for developers\n\n![Tests](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)\n![Build status](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/actions/workflows/release-build.yml/badge.svg)\n![Docker builds](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/actions/workflows/build-docker.yml/badge.svg)\n![CodeQL](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg)\n[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/axllent/mailpit)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/axllent/mailpit)\n\nMailpit is a small, fast, low memory, zero-dependency, multi-platform email testing tool & API for developers.\n\nIt acts as an SMTP server, provides a modern web interface to view & test captured emails, and contains an API for automated integration testing.\n\nMailpit was originally **inspired** by MailHog which is now [no longer maintained](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/issues/442#issuecomment-1493415258) and hasn't seen active development for a few years now.\n\n![Mailpit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axllent/mailpit/develop/docs/screenshot.png)\n\n\n## Features\n\n- Runs entirely from a single binary, no installation required\n- SMTP server (default `0.0.0.0:1025`)\n- Web UI to view emails (formatted HTML, highlighted HTML source, text, headers, raw source and MIME attachments including image thumbnails)\n- HTML check to test & score mail client compatibility with HTML emails\n- Link check to test message links (HTML & text) & linked images\n- Light & dark web UI theme with auto-detect\n- Mobile and tablet HTML preview toggle in desktop mode\n- Advanced mail search ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Mail-search))\n- Message tagging ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Tagging))\n- Real-time web UI updates using web sockets for new mail\n- Optional browser notifications for new mail (when accessed via either HTTPS or `localhost` only)\n- Configurable automatic email pruning (default keeps the most recent 500 emails)\n- Email storage either in a temporary or persistent database ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Email-storage))\n- Fast SMTP processing & storing - approximately 70-100 emails per second depending on CPU, network speed & email size, easily handling tens of thousands of emails\n- SMTP relaying / message release - relay messages via a different SMTP server including an optional allowlist of accepted recipients ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/SMTP-relay))\n- Optional SMTP with STARTTLS & SMTP authentication, including an \"accept anything\" mode ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/SMTP-with-STARTTLS-and-authentication))\n- Optional HTTPS for web UI ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/HTTPS))\n- Optional basic authentication for web UI ([see wiki](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Basic-authentication))\n- A simple REST API ([see docs](docs/apiv1/README.md))\n- Multi-architecture [Docker images](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Docker-images)\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThe Mailpit web UI listens by default on `http://0.0.0.0:8025`, and the SMTP port on `0.0.0.0:1025`.\n\nMailpit runs as a single binary and can be installed in different ways:\n\n\n### Install via Brew (Mac)\n\nInstall Mailpit with `brew install mailpit`.\n\n\n### Install via bash script (Linux & Mac)\n\nLinux & Mac users can install it directly to `/usr/local/bin/mailpit` with:\n\n```bash\nsudo bash < <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axllent/mailpit/develop/install.sh)\n```\n\n\n### Download static binary (Windows, Linux and Mac)\n\nStatic binaries can always be found on the [releases](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/releases/latest). The `mailpit` binary can extracted and copied to your `$PATH`, or simply run as `./mailpit`.\n\n\n### Docker\n\nSee [Docker instructions](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Docker-images) for 386, amd64 & arm64 images.\n\n\n### Compile from source\n\nTo build Mailpit from source see [building from source](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Building-from-source).\n\n\n## Usage\n\nRun `mailpit -h` to see options. More information can be seen in [the docs](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Runtime-options).\n\n\n\n### Testing Mailpit\n\nPlease refer to [the documentation](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Testing-Mailpit) of how to easily test email delivery to Mailpit.\n\n\n### Configuring sendmail\n\nMailpit's SMTP server (by default on port 1025), so you will likely need to configure your sending application to deliver mail via that port. A common MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) that delivers system emails to a SMTP server is `sendmail`, used by many applications including PHP. Mailpit can also act as substitute for sendmail. For instructions of how to set this up, please refer to the [sendmail documentation](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/wiki/Configuring-sendmail)."
