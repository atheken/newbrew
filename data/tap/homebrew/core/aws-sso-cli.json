It shares\na lot in common with [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault),\nbut is more focused on the AWS SSO use case instead of static API credentials.\nCheck out [this page](docs/aws-vault.md) for more information on how these\ntwo tools compare.\n\nAWS SSO CLI requires your AWS account(s) to be setup with [AWS SSO](\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/)!  If your organization is using the\nolder SAML integration (typically you will have multiple tiles in OneLogin/Okta)\nthen this won't work for you.\n\n## How to read these docs\n\nIn general, I do feature development in feature branches and then merge to\nthe `main` branch when that feature is stable.  I also tend to try to include\nany documentation changes in those pull requests.  Once a release is ready,\nI tag the tip of `main` and do the release.\n\nWhat that means is that the documentation you see here (tip of `main`) may\ninclude features that are not in the latest release.  To view the docs for\nyour release, please use the branch selector ![branch selector](\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1075352/167158202-93312c5c-cbb8-403f-9e2b-4eb34e2634f3.png)\nnear the top of this page to choose the tag of the version of AWS SSO CLI\nthat you are using.\n\n## What does AWS SSO CLI do?\n\n### Overview\n\nAWS SSO CLI makes it easy to manage your shell environment variables allowing\nyou to access the AWS API & web console using CLI tools.  Unlike the official\nAWS tooling, the `aws-sso` command does not require manually creating named\nprofiles in your `~/.aws/config` (or anywhere else for that matter) for each\nand every role you wish to assume and use.\n\n`aws-sso` focuses on making it easy to select a role via CLI arguments or\nvia an interactive auto-complete experience with automatic and user-defined\nmetadata (tags) and exports the necessary [AWS STS Token credentials](\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html#using-temp-creds-sdk-cli)\nto your shell environment in a variety of ways.\n\nAs part of the goal of improving the end-user experience with AWS SSO, it also\nsupports using [multiple AWS Web Console sessions](docs/quickstart.md#aws-console-access)\nand many other quality of life improvements!\n\n### Key Features\n\n * Enhanced security over stock AWS tooling\n * Auto-discover your AWS SSO roles and [manage](docs/commands.md#config)\n     your `~/.aws/config` file\n * Support selecting an IAM role via `$AWS_PROFILE`, CLI (with auto-completion)\n    or interactive search\n * Ability to select roles based on [user-defined](docs/config.md#tags)\n    and auto-discovered tags\n * Support for [multiple active AWS Console sessions](docs/config.md#firefoxopenurlincontainer)\n * Guided setup to help you configure `aws-sso` the first time you run\n * Advanced configuration available to [adjust colors](docs/config.md#PromptColors)\n    and generate [named profiles via templates](docs/config.md#ProfileFormat)\n * Easily see how much longer your STS credentials [are valid for](docs/commands.md#time)\n * Written in GoLang, so only need to install a single binary (no dependencies)\n * Supports Linux, MacOS, and Windows\n\n## Demos\n\nHere's a quick demo showing how to select a role to assume in interactive mode\nand then run commands in that context (by default it starts a new shell):\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/462167.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/462167)\n\n\n`aws-sso` also allows you to open the AWS Console in your browser for a\ngiven AWS SSO role:\n\n![FirefoxContainers Demo](\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1075352/166165880-24f7c9af-a037-4e48-aa2d-342f2efe5ad7.gif)\n\nWant to see more?  Check out the [other demos](docs/demos.md).\n\n## Security\n\nPlease note their is also a [Security Policy](security.md).\n\nUnlike the official [AWS cli tooling](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), _all_\nauthentication tokens and credentials used for accessing AWS and your SSO\nprovider are encrypted on disk using your choice of secure storage solution.\nAll encryption is handled by the [99designs/keyring](https://github.com/99designs/keyring)\nlibrary which is also used by [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault).\n\nCredentials encrypted by `aws-sso` and not via the standard AWS CLI tool:\n\n * AWS SSO ClientID/ClientSecret -- `~/.aws/sso/cache/botocore-client-id-<region>.json`\n * AWS SSO AccessToken -- `~/.aws/sso/cache/<random>.json`\n * AWS Profile Access Credentials -- `~/.aws/cli/cache/<random>.json`\n\nAs you can see, not only does the standard AWS CLI tool expose the temporary\nAWS access credentials to your IAM roles, but more importantly the SSO\nAccessToken which can be used to fetch IAM credentials for any role you have\nbeen granted access!\n\n### What is not encrypted?\n\n * Contents of user defined `~/.aws-sso/config.yaml`\n * Metadata associated with the AWS Roles fetched via AWS SSO in `~/.aws-sso/cache.json`\n    * Email address tied to the account (root user)\n    * AWS Account Alias\n    * AWS Role ARN\n\n## What next?\n\nThe following pages will help get you started:\n\n * [Quick Start & Installation Guide](docs/quickstart.md)\n * [Running aws-sso](docs/commands.md)\n * [Configuration](docs/config.md)\n * [Frequently Asked Questions](docs/FAQ.md)\n\n## License\n\nAWS SSO CLI is licensed under the [GPLv3](LICENSE)."
