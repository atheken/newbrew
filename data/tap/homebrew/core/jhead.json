  "readme": "JHEAD is a simple command line tool for displaying and some manipulation\nof EXIF header data embedded in Jpeg images from digital cameras.\n\nJhead is part of the online repository of many linux distribution, \nyou can install the package using \"apt install jhead\"\n\nFor command line options, please see usage.html\n\nSome notes:\n\n    When I first wrote Jhead back in 1999, there wasn't much software around\n    for looking inside Exif headers, so I wrote jhead for that task.  Since\n    then, a lot of much more sophisticated programs for looking inside Exif\n    headers have been written, many with GUIs, and features that Jhead lacks.\n\n    Seeing that Jhead does everything I need it to do, My goal is not to have\n    every feature imaginable.  Rather, I want Jhead to be a small, simple,\n    easy to understand program.  My goal is that if you need to understand\n    Exif internals, or add Exif capability to your program, Jhead is the\n    place to cut and paste code from.\n\n    If jhead doesn't have a feature you want, look for \"exiftool\".  Exiftool\n    has any feature you could imagine, but it's also 100x bigger and much\n    slower.\n\n    If you find that it dies on a certain jpeg file, send it to me, and I\n    will look at it.\n\n\nCompiling:\n\n    Windows:\n\n    Make sure visual C is on your path (I use version 6 from 1998,\n    but it shouldn't matter much).\n    Run the batch file make.bat\n\n    Linux & Unices:\n\n    type 'make'.\n\n\tThere is also a suite of regression tests in the \"tests\" directory.\n\tAfter compiling, from the tests directory run \"runtests\"\n\tTo check the results, do \"diff expected-txt results-txt\"\n\nPortability:\n\n    Although I have never done so myself, people tell me it compiles\n    under platforms as diverse as such as Mac OS-X, or NetBSD on Mac68k.\n    Jhead doesn't care about the endian-ness of your CPU, and should not\n    have problems with processors that do not handle unaligned data,\n    such as ARM.\n\n    Jhead has also made its way into various Linux distributions and ports\n    trees, so you might already have it on your system without knowing.\n\nLicense:\n\n    Jhead is public domain software - that is, you can do whatever you want\n    with it, and include it software that is licensed under the GNU or the\n    BSD license, or whatever other license you chose, including proprietary\n    closed source licenses.  Although not part of the license, I do expect\n    common courtesy, please.\n\n    If you do integrate the code into some software of yours, I'd appreciate\n    knowing about it though.\n\nMatthias Wandel"
