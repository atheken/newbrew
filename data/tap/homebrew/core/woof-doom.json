WAD files in these directories are loaded before those passed to the `-file` parameter, DEHACKED files in these directories are processed after those passed to the `-deh` parameter and before those embedded into WAD files. Additionally, autoload directories for PWADs are also supported in a similar manner, but these directories will need to be created manually.\n * Savegame backward compatibility across different platforms and releases is maintained, so it is possible to restore savegames from previous versions and even MBF.EXE.\n * Integration of the Chocolate Doom network code. Demo compatible multiplayer for all supported complevels allowing for cross-port network games with the Chocolate family of ports, e.g. Crispy Doom (remember to set `-complevel vanilla` for the server).\n\n## Rendering\n\n * The renderer has been made much more robust against common rendering bugs which were found especially in extremely huge levels and levels with extreme heights or height differences.\n * Support for rendering with uncapped frame rate and frame interpolation has been added.\n * A widescreen rendering mode has been added with proper support for the widescreen assets found e.g. in the Unity version of Doom.\n * Screenshots are saved in PNG format and are actual representations of the game screen rendering.\n\n## Sound\n\n * The port uses OpenAL for music and sound mixing. It is able to play back sounds in any format supported by libsndfile and precaches them in memory at start up.\n * The port provides several music backends: MIDI music is played back natively on Windows, or using the fluidsynth renderer with a soundfont (if available), or using the built-in OPL3 emulator. Digital music formats are played back with libsndfile, module music is rendered with libxmp.\n\n## Input\n\n * The port allows to bind each action to multiple keys and mouse or joystick buttons, and unbind them using the <kbd>Del</kbd> key in the menu.\n * The port provides modern gamepad support allowing to bind any action to shoulder triggers or analog sticks.\n * Support for mouselook has been added.\n\n## Capability\n\n * The level building code has been upgraded to allow for loading maps in \"extended nodes\" format. Furthermore, maps using nodes in DeePBSP and (either compressed or uncompressed) ZDBSP formats can now be loaded.\n * Support for tall textures and sprites in DeePsea format has been added.\n * Support for unlimited extra states, sprites, mobjtypes and sounds has been added for use in Dehacked patches (supporting the \"DEHEXTRA\" and \"DSDHacked\" specs).\n * Support for changing in-game music using the \"MUSINFO\" lump has been added.\n * Support for the \"UMAPINFO\" lump has been added, compliant to Rev 2.0 of the spec.\n * Support for the \"MBF21\" compatibility level has been added.\n * Support for SMMU swirling animated flats.\n * Ability to customize the appearance of the extended Boom HUD using the [WOOFHUD](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof/blob/master/docs/woofhud.md) lump.\n\n## Compatibility\n\n * All IWAD files since Doom 1.2 are supported, including Doom Shareware, The Ultimate Doom, Doom 2 and Final Doom. Furthermore, the IWAD files shipped with the \"Doom 3: BFG Edition\" and the ones published by the Freedoom project as well as Chex Quest, HACX and REKKR are supported.\n * UMAPINFO lumps for MASTERLEVELS.WAD, NERVE.WAD, SIGIL_V1_21.WAD, E1M4B.WAD and E1M8B.WAD have been added which are meant to be autoloaded with the corresponding PWAD and change map title, level transitions, par times, music and skies accordingly.\n * The concept of compatibility levels has been added, currently offering \"Vanilla\", \"Boom\", \"MBF\" and \"MBF21\" (default). The default compatibility level may be changed through the menu and overridden with the `-complevel` parameter, allowing for both numeric and named arguments, or the `COMPLVL` lump. Menu items in the Setup menu that don't apply to the current compatibility level are disabled and grayed out.\n * The project strives for full demo compatibility for all supported complevels. Furthermore, this port offers quality-of-life features like e.g. a demo progress bar, demo playback warp and skip as well as continued demo recording.\n * The SPECHITS, REJECT, INTERCEPTS and DONUT overflow emulations have been ported over from Chocolate Doom / PrBoom+, allowing for some more obscure Vanilla demos to keep sync.\n\n# Releases\n\nSource code and Windows binaries (MSVC builds for Windows 7 and newer) for the latest release can be found on the [Release](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof/releases/latest) page.\n\nThe most recent list of changes can be found in the [Changelog](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\n\nA complete history of changes and releases can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof/wiki/Changelog) or on the [Releases](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof/releases) page.\n\n# Compiling\n\nThe Woof! source code is available at GitHub: <https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof>.\n\nIt can be cloned via\n\n```\n git clone https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof.git\n```\n\n## Linux, and Windows with MSYS2\n\nThe following libraries need to be installed:\n\n * [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/SDL2) (>= 2.0.18)\n * [SDL2_net](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_net)\n * [openal-soft](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft)\n * [libsndfile](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile) (>= 1.1.0 for MPEG support)\n * [fluidsynth](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth) (>= 2.2.0, optional)\n * [libxmp](https://github.com/libxmp/libxmp) (optional)\n \nUsually your distribution should have the corresponding packages in its repositories, and if your distribution has \"dev\" versions of those libraries, those are the ones you'll need.\n\nOnce installed, compilation should be as simple as:\n\n```\n cd woof\n mkdir build; cd build\n cmake ..\n make\n```\n\nAfter successful compilation the resulting binary can be found in the `src/` directory.\n\n## Windows with Visual Studio\n\nVisual Studio 2019 and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) comes with built-in support for CMake by opening the source tree as a folder.\n\nInstall vcpkg <https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-windows>. Integrate it into CMake or use toolchain file:\n```\n cd woof\n cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=\"[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake\"\n cmake --build build\n```\nCMake will automatically download and build all dependencies for you.\n\n# Contact\n\nThe canonical homepage for Woof! is <https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof>.\n\nWoof! is maintained by [Fabian Greffrath](mailto:fabian@greffXremovethisXrath.com). \n\nPlease report any bugs, glitches or crashes that you encounter to the GitHub [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof/issues).\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nMBF has always been a special Doom source port for me, as it taught me how to implement 640x400 resolution rendering which was the base for my own source port project [Crispy Doom](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom).\nAs the original MBF was limited to run only under MS-DOS, I used its pure port WinMBF by Team Eternity to study and debug the code.\nOver time, I got increasingly frustrated that the code would only compile and run on 32-bit systems and still use the meanwhile outdated SDL-1 libraries.\nThis is how this project was born.\n\nMany additions and improvements to this source port were taken from fraggle's [Chocolate Doom](https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom), taking advantage of its exceptional portability, accuracy and compatibility.\n\n# Legalese\n\nFiles: `*`  \nCopyright:  \n © 1993-1996 Id Software, Inc.;  \n © 1993-2008 Raven Software;  \n © 1999 by id Software, Chi Hoang, Lee Killough, Jim Flynn, Rand Phares, Ty Halderman;  \n © 2004 James Haley;  \n © 2005-2018 Simon Howard;  \n © 2006 Ben Ryves;  \n © 2017 Christoph Oelckers;  \n © 2019 Fernando Carmona Varo;  \n © 2019 Jonathan Dowland;  \n © 2020 Alex Mayfield;  \n © 2021 Ryan Krafnick;  \n © 2022 ceski;  \n © 2023 liPillON;  \n © 2020-2023 Fabian Greffrath;  \n © 2020-2023 Roman Fomin.  \nLicense: [GPL-2.0+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html)\n\nFiles: `src/beta.h`  \nCopyright: © 2001-2019 Contributors to the Freedoom project.  \nLicense: [BSD-3-Clause](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)\n\nFiles: `src/dogs.h`  \nCopyright:  \n © 2017 Nash Muhandes;  \n © apolloaiello;  \n © TobiasKosmos.  \nLicense: [CC-BY-3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) and [CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n\nFiles: `src/u_scanner.*`  \nCopyright:  \n © 2010 Braden \"Blzut3\" Obrzut;  \n © 2019 Fernando Carmona Varo.  \nLicense: [BSD-3-Clause](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)\n\nFiles: `cmake/FindSDL2.cmake, cmake/FindSDL2_net.cmake`  \nCopyright: © 2018 Alex Mayfield.  \nLicense: [BSD-3-Clause](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)\n\nFiles: `data/woof.ico, data/woof.png, src/icon.c, data/setup.ico, data/woof-setup.png, setup/setup_icon.c, src/thermo.h`  \nCopyright: © 2020-2022 Julia Nechaevskaya.  \nLicense: [CC-BY-3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\n\nFiles: `miniz/*`  \nCopyright:  \n © 2010-2014 Rich Geldreich and Tenacious Software LLC;  \n © 2013-2014 RAD Game Tools and Valve Software.  \nLicense: [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\nFiles: `opl/*`  \nCopyright:  \n © 2005-2014 Simon Howard;  \n © 2013-2018 Alexey Khokholov (Nuke.YKT).  \nLicense: [GPL-2.0+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html)\n\nFiles: `soundfonts/TimGM6mb.sf2`  \nCopyright:  \n © 2004 Tim Brechbill;  \n © 2010 David Bolton.  \nLicense: [GPL-2.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html)\n\nFiles: `textscreen/*`  \nCopyright:  \n © 1993-1996 Id Software, Inc.;  \n © 2002-2004 The DOSBox Team;  \n © 2005-2017 Simon Howard.  \nLicense: [GPL-2.0+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html)\n\nFiles: `win32/win_opendir.*`  \nLicense: public-domain"
