However, there are a few things that are not demonstrated by this \nreference implementation.\n\n* Stereo channels\n* EndOfFileFiller\n* Arbitrary attributes and naming validations\n* half type attributes\n* keycode value validations\n\n\n## Installation Prerequisites ##\n\n__CMake__\n\nCMake can be downloaded directly from www.cmake.org or use one of the commands \nbelow.\n\n* Ubuntu\n\n        $ sudo apt-get install cmake\n\n* Redhat\n\n        $ yum install cmake\n\n* OS X\n\n    * Install homebrew if not already installed\n    \n            $ ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)\"\n                \n    * Install Cmake\n    \n            $ brew install cmake         \n             \n## Installation ##\n\n* OS X\n\n    * Install homebrew if not already installed\n\n            $ ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)\"\n        \n    * Install aces_container\n    \n            $ brew install aces_container  \n\n\t\t\n        \n* From Source\n\n    From the root source directory:\n    \n        $ mkdir build && cd build\n        $ cmake ..\n        $ make\n        $ sudo make install\n\n    The default process will install ``libAcesContainer.so`` to ``/usr/local/lib``\n    and a number of header files into ``/usr/local/include/aces``\n    \n    \n\t\t\n               \n* Windows \n    * Download CMake Windows Installer from https://cmake.org/download/. Be sure add \"CMake\" to PATH during the installation. \n\n\t* x86\t\n\t    \n\t    From the root source directory:\n\n\t\t\t> mkdir build \n\t\t\t> cd build\n\t\t\t> cmake .. -G \"Visual Studio 10 2010\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\tPlease check the version of Visual Studio on your PC before using cmake to generate any solution files. Some other available versions are ``Visual Studio 11 2012`` and ``Visual Studio 14 2015``. The Visual Studio solution files will be generated in ``.\\build``. You can open ``AcesContainer.sln`` project solution file to continue the building process. If succeed, the ``AcesContainer.dll`` should be in ``.\\Debug`` and/or ``.\\Release``. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t* x64\t\n\t    \n\t    From the root source directory:\n\n\t\t\t> mkdir build\n\t\t\t> cd build\n\t\t\t> cmake .. -G \"Visual Studio 10 2010 Win64\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\tPlease check the version of Visual Studio on your PC before using cmake to generate any solution files.
