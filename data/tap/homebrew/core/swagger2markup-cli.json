There are many interesting new topics:\n1) Swagger v3 support\n2) Fixing bugs\n2) Merge Swagger2Markup repositories and create a new multi-module repository.\nAny help is welcome.\nKind regards,\nRobert\n\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to *simplify the generation of an up-to-date RESTful API documentation by combining documentation that's been hand-written with auto-generated API documentation* produced by https://github.com/swagger-api[Swagger]. The result is intended to be an *up-to-date, easy-to-read, on- and offline user guide*, comparable to https://developer.github.com/v3/[GitHub's API documentation]. The output of Swagger2Markup can be used as an alternative to https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui[swagger-ui] and can be served as static content.\nNOTE: The Swagger Specification has been donated to to the https://openapis.org/[Open API Initiative (OAI)] and has been renamed to the https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification[OpenAPI Specification].\n\nSwagger2Markup converts a Swagger JSON or YAML file into several *AsciiDoc* or *GitHub Flavored Markdown* documents which can be combined with hand-written documentation. The Swagger source file can be located locally or remotely via HTTP. Swagger2Markup supports the Swagger 1.2 and 2.0 specification. Internally it uses the _official_ https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-parser[swagger-parser] and my https://github.com/RobWin/markup-document-builder[markup-document-builder].\n\nYou can use Swagger2Markup to convert your contract-first Swagger YAML file into a human-readable format and combine it with hand-written documentation. As an alternative, you can choose the code-first approach and use Swagger2Markup together with https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Swagger-Core-JAX-RS-Project-Setup-1.5.X[Swagger JAX-RS], https://github.com/springfox/springfox[springfox] or https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-restdocs[spring-restdocs]. If you are Gradle or Maven user, you can also use the https://github.com/RobWin/swagger2markup-gradle-plugin[Swagger2Markup Gradle Plugin] or https://github.com/redowl/swagger2markup-maven-plugin[Swagger2markup Maven Plugin].\n\nhttp://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc] is preferable to Markdown as it has more features. AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing documentation, articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages and blogs. AsciiDoc files can be converted to *HTML*, *PDF* and *EPUB*. AsciiDoc is much better suited for describing public APIs than *JavaDoc* or *Annotations*.\n\nYou can generate your HTML5, PDF and EPUB documentation via https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj[asciidoctorj] or even better via the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin[asciidoctor-gradle-plugin] or https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-plugin[asciidoctor-maven-plugin].\n\nThe project requires at least JDK 8.\n\n== Example\n\nimage::swagger2markup-documentation/src/docs/asciidoc/images/Swagger2Markup.PNG[]\n\nimage::swagger2markup-documentation/src/docs/asciidoc/images/Swagger2Markup_definitions.PNG[]\n\n== Reference documentation\n- http://swagger2markup.github.io/swagger2markup/1.3.3/[Reference Documentation]\n- https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup/blob/master/RELEASENOTES.adoc[Release notes]\n- https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/spring-swagger2markup-demo[Demo using Swagger2Markup, Spring Boot, Springfox and spring-restdocs]\n\n== Contributing\n\n=== Community contributions\n\nPull requests are welcome.\n\n=== Questions\nYou can ask questions about Swagger2Markup in https://gitter.im/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup[Gitter].\n\n=== Bugs\nIf you believe you have found a bug, please take a moment to search the existing issues. If no one else has reported the problem, please open a new issue that describes the problem in detail and, ideally, includes a test that reproduces it.\n\n=== Enhancements\nIf youâ€™d like an enhancement to be made to Swagger2Markup, pull requests are most welcome. The source code is on GitHub. You may want to search the existing issues and pull requests to see if the enhancement is already being worked on. You may also want to open a new issue to discuss a possible enhancement before work on it begins.\n\n== Companies who use Swagger2Markup\n\n* Deutsche Telekom AG\n* https://restlet.com/[Restlet] -- Restlet offers an API platform, covering the https://restlet.com/products/restlet-studio/[design], https://restlet.com/products/dhc/[test] and https://restlet.com/products/apispark/[operation] of Web APIs, and uses Swagger2Markup to generate appealing HTML documentation from API definitions.\n* http://www.qaware.de/[QAware GmbH]\n* http://www.appdirect.com/[AppDirect] -- The leading commerce platform for selling cloud services.\n* http://www.wescale.com[wescale]\n* http://taskassure.com[TaskAssure] \n* https://www.isaac.nl[ISAAC]\n* https://www.spreadshirt.de[Spreadshirt]\n\n== License\n\nCopyright 2015 Robert Winkler\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
