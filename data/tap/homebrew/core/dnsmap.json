  "readme": "# dnsmap\n\n#### dnsmap - scan for subdomains using brute-forcing techniques\n\n## Help this project ##\n\ndnsmap needs your help. **If you are a programmer** and if you want to help a\nnice project, this is your opportunity.\n\ndnsmap was imported from some tarballs (the original homepage[1] and\ndevelopers are inactive). After this, all patches found in Debian project and\nother places for this program were applied. All initial work was registered in\nChangeLog file (version 1.6 and later releases). dnsmap is being packaged\nin Debian[2] Project.\n\nIf you are interested to help dnsmap, read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n\n[1]: https://code.google.com/archive/p/dnsmap/\n[2]: https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/dnsmap\n\n## What is dnsmap? ##\n\ndnsmap scans a domain for common subdomains using a built-in or an external\nwordlist (if specified using -w option). The internal wordlist has around 1000\nwords in English and Spanish as ns1, firewall servicios and smtp. So will be\npossible search for smtp.example.com inside example.com automatically. Results\ncan be saved in CSV and human-readable format for further processing. dnsmap\ndoes NOT require root privileges to be run, and should NOT be run with such\nprivileges for security reasons.\n\ndnsmap was originally released back in 2006 and was inspired by the fictional\nstory \"The Thief No One Saw\" by Paul Craig, which can be found in the book\n\"Stealing the Network - How to 0wn the Box\".\n\ndnsmap is mainly meant to be used by pentesters during the information\ngathering/enumeration phase of infrastructure security assessments. During the\nenumeration stage, the security consultant would typically discover the target\ncompany's IP netblocks, domain names, phone numbers, etc.\n\nSubdomain brute-forcing is another technique that should be used in the\nenumeration stage, as it's especially useful when other domain enumeration\ntechniques such as zone transfers don't work (I rarely see zone transfers being\npublicly allowed these days by the way).\n\nFun things that can happen:\n\n 1. Finding interesting remote access servers (e.g.:\n    https:<span>://</span>extranet.example.com).\n\n 2. Finding badly configured and/or unpatched servers (e.g.: test.example.com).\n\n 3. Finding new domain names which will allow you to map\n    non-obvious/hard-to-find netblocks of your target organization (registry\n    lookups - aka whois is your friend).\n\n 4. Sometimes you find that some bruteforced subdomains resolve to internal IP\n    addresses (RFC 1918).     This is great as sometimes they are real\n    up-to-date \"A\" records which means that it *is* possible to enumerate\n    internal servers of a target organization from the Internet by only using\n    standard DNS resolving (as opposed to zone transfers for instance).\n\n 5. Discover embedded devices configured using Dynamic DNS services (e.g.: IP\n    Cameras). This method     is an alternative to finding devices via Google\n    hacking techniques.\n\n## Build and Install ##\n\nTo build and install, run the following commands:\n\n    $ ./autogen.sh\n    $ ./configure\n    $ make\n    # make install\n\nTo return to original source code you can use '$ make distclean' command.\n\nOn Debian systems you can use '# apt install dnsmap'.\n\n## Author ##\n\ndnsmap was originally developed by \"pagvac\" under GPL-2+ license.\n\nCurrently, the source code and newer versions are available at\nhttps://github.com/resurrecting-open-source-projects/dnsmap"
