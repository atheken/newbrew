  "readme": "# Improved Nano Syntax Highlighting Files\n\nThis repository holds ``{lang}.nanorc`` files that have improved definitions of syntax highlighting for various languages.\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are three ways to install this repo.\n\n### 1. Automatic installer\n\nCopy the following code to download and run the installer script:\n\n```sh\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scopatz/nanorc/master/install.sh | sh\n```\n\nIf your machine doesn't have `curl` command, use this code:\n\n```sh\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scopatz/nanorc/master/install.sh -O- | sh\n```\n\nThis automatically unpacks all the `.nanorc` files to `~/.nano`.\n\n#### Note\n\nSome syntax definitions which exist in Nano upstream may be preferable to the ones provided by this package.  \nThe ` install.sh` script may be run with `-l` or `--lite` to insert the included syntax definitions from this package with *lower* precedence than the ones provided by the standard package.\n\n### 2. Package managers\n\nThe follow table lists all systems with this package published.  \nFeel free to add your official package manager.\n\n> Systems that are based in others' package managers or repositories are compatible. For example: `pacman` based systems are compatible with `Arch Linux`.\n\n| System     | Command                                  |\n| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| Arch Linux | `pacman -S nano-syntax-highlighting`     |\n\n### 3. Clone repo (copy the files)\n\nThe files should be placed inside of the `~/.nano/` directory.\n\nYou can put the files in another directory inside the correct `.nano` folder.\nFor example: `~/.nano/nanorc/`.\nFor readability will use `$install_path` for the path of your choose (in *system wide* the path is always `/usr/share/nano-syntax-highlighting/`).\n\nFor user, only run:\n\n`git clone git@github.com:scopatz/nanorc.git $install_path` or  \n`git clone https://github.com/scopatz/nanorc.git $install_path`\n\nFor system wide, run:\n\n`sudo git clone https://github.com/scopatz/nanorc.git $install_path`\n\n## Configuration\n\nAfter installation, you need to inform `nano` to used the new highlight files. \nThe configuration file is located at `~/.nanorc`, for users, and at `/etc/nanorc`, for system wide.\nIf this file doesn't exist, create a new one.\n\nAgain there are three ways:\n\n### 1. Include all\n\nAppend the content of the folder in one line, with wildcard:\n\n`echo \"include $install_path/*.nanorc\" >> ~/.nanorc` or  \n`echo \"include $install_path/*.nanorc\" >> /etc/nanorc`\n\n### 2. Include/append our `nanorc` file\n\nSimply run:\n\n`cat $install_path/nanorc >> ~/.nanorc` or  \n`cat $install_path/nanorc >> /etc/nanorc`\n\n### 3. One by one\n\nAdd your preferable languages one by one into the file. For example:\n\n```\n## C/C++\ninclude \"~/.nano/c.nanorc\"\n```\n\n## Tricks & Tweaks\n\n### MacOS\n\n`\\<` and `\\>` are regular character escapes on MacOS.  \nThe bug is fixed in Nano, but this might be a problem if you are using an older version  \nIf this is the case, replace them respectively with `[[:<:]]` and `[[:>:]]`.\nThis is reported in [Issue 52](https://github.com/scopatz/nanorc/issues/52).\n\n### Why not include the original files?\n\nGood question! It's due to the way that nano reads the files, the regex instructions should be in a _specific order_ which is evident in some nanorc files.\nAnd if we use the `include` or `extendsyntax` commands, the colors or other things may not work as expected.  \nThe best way to make changes is by copying and editing the original files.  \nPlease see this [issue](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?5698).   \nBut if some original nanorc file needs an update, feel free to [patch it](https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?func=additem&group=nano)!\n\n### My shortcut is not working!\n\nPlease see this [issue](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?56994).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nSome of these files are derived from the original [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org) editor [repo](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/nano.git)"
