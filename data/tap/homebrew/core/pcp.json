You can find the preprint [below](#research)._\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Motivation](#motivation)\n- [Project Status](#project-status)\n- [How does it work?](#how-does-it-work)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Install](#install)\n  - [Release download](#release-download) | [From source](#from-source) | [Package managers](#package-managers)\n- [Development](#development)\n  - [Protobuf definitions](#generate-protobuf-definitions)\n- [Feature Roadmap](#feature-roadmap)\n- [Related Efforts](#related-efforts)\n- [Maintainers](#maintainers)\n- [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments)\n- [Research](#research)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Motivation\n\nThere already exists a long list of file transfer tools (see [Related Efforts](#related-efforts)), so why bother\nbuilding another one? The problem I had with the existing tools is that they rely on\na [limited set of](https://github.com/schollz/croc/issues/289) [servers](https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/welcome.html#relays)\nto orchestrate peer matching and data relaying which poses a centralisation concern. Many of the usual centralisation\nvs. decentralisation arguments apply here, e.g. the servers are single points of failures, the service operator has the\npower over whom to serve and whom not, etc. Further, as\nthis [recent issue in croc](https://github.com/schollz/croc/issues/289) shows, this is a real risk for sustainable\noperation of the provided service.\n\n[comment]: <> (The `identify` discovery mechanism serves the same role as `STUN`, but without the need for a set of `STUN` servers. The libp2p `Circuit Relay` protocol allows peers to communicate indirectly via a helpful intermediary peer that is found via the DHT. This replaces dedicated `TURN` servers.)\n\n## Project Status\n\nThe tool is in a very early stage, and I'm aware of performance, usability and **security** issues. Don't use it for anything serious.\nAlthough I criticised tools like [`magic-wormhole`](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole) or [`croc`](https://github.com/schollz/croc) above, they are amazing and way more mature.\n\nThere are also drawbacks with this approach: It's slower than established centralised methods if\nyou want to transmit data across network boundaries. A DHT query to find your peer can easily take several minutes.\nFurther, the bandwidth and geographic location of a potential relaying peer is not guaranteed which can lead to long transmission times.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nWhen running `pcp send` you'll see four random words from a list of the Bitcoin improvement proposal [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md).\nThere are lists in nine different languages of 2048 words each, currently only `english` is supported.\nThe first word is interpreted as a channel ID in the range from 0 to 2047.\n`pcp` advertises the identifier `/pcp/{unix-timestamp}/{channel-id}` in its local network via [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS) and a hashed version of this string in the [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) of [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System).\nThe unix timestamp is the current time truncated to 5 minutes and the prefix `/pcp` is the protocol prefix.\n_In the future:_ When you enter a new 5-minute interval while `pcp send` is running it advertises an updated identifier.\n\nTo receive the file your peer enters `pcp receive four-words-from-above` and `pcp` uses the first word together with the current time truncated to 5 minutes to find the sending peer in the [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) and in your local network via [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS).\nIt also searches for an identifier of the previous 5-minute interval.\nAs soon as the peer is found, both do a password authenticated key exchange ([PAKE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement)) to authenticate each other.\nIn this procedure a comparably weak password (`four-words-from-above`) gets replaced with a strong session key that is used to encrypt all future communication.\nThe default [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) encryption that [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p) provides is not sufficient in this case as we could still, in theory, talk to a wrong peer - just encrypted.\n\nAfter the peer is authenticated the receiver must confirm the file transfer, and the file gets transmitted. \n\n## Usage\n\nThe sending peer runs:\n\n```shell\n$ pcp send my_file\nCode is:  bubble-enemy-result-increase\nOn the other machine run:\n\tpcp receive bubble-enemy-result-increase\n```\n\nThe receiving peer runs:\n\n```shell\n$ pcp receive bubble-enemy-result-increase\nLooking for peer bubble-enemy-result-increase...\n```\n\nIf you're on different networks the lookup can take quite long (~ 2-3 minutes). Currently, there is no output while both parties are working on peer discovery, so just be very patient.\n\n## Install\n\n### Package managers\n\n```shell\nbrew install pcp\n```\n\nIt's on the roadmap to also distribute `pcp` via `apt`, `yum`, `scoop` and more ...\n\n### Release download\n\nHead over to the [releases](https://github.com/dennis-tra/pcp/releases) and download the latest archive for\nyour platform.\n\n### From source\n\nTo compile it yourself run:\n\n```shell\ngo install github.com/dennis-tra/pcp/cmd/pcp@latest # Go 1.13 or higher is required\n```\n\nMake sure the `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH` variable to access the installed `pcp` executable.\n\n## Development\n\n### Protobuf definitions\n\nFirst install the protoc compiler:\n\n```shell\nmake tools # downloads gofumpt and protoc\nmake proto # generates protobuf\n```\n\nThe current proto definitions were generated with `libprotoc 3.14.0`.\n\n## Feature Roadmap\n\nShamelessly copied from `croc`:\n\n- [x] allows any two computers to transfer data (using a relay)\n  - ✅ using mDNS and DHT for peer discovery and [AutoRelay](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/circuit-relay/#autorelay) / [AutoNat](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/#autonat)\n- [x] provides end-to-end encryption (using PAKE)\n  - ✅ yup, it uses [`pake/v2`](https://github.com/schollz/pake/tree/v2.0.6) from `croc`\n- [x] enables easy cross-platform transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)\n  - ✅ Linux <-> Mac, ❌ Windows, but it's planned!\n- [x] allows multiple file transfers\n  - ✅ it allows transferring directories\n- [ ] allows resuming transfers that are interrupted\n  - ❌ not yet\n- [x] local server or port-forwarding not needed\n  - ✅ thanks to [AutoNat](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/#autonat)\n- [x] ipv6-first with ipv4 fallback\n  - ✅ thanks to [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/)\n- [ ] can use proxy, like tor\n  - ❌ not yet\n\nYou can find a project plan in the [project tab](https://github.com/dennis-tra/pcp/projects/2) of this page.\nSome other ideas I would love to work on include:\n\n- [ ] browser interop via the means of [js-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p)\n- [ ] experimental decentralised NAT hole punching via DHT signaling servers - [Project Flare](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/1039)\n\n## Related Efforts\n\n- [`croc`](https://github.com/schollz/croc) - Easily and securely send things from one computer to another\n- [`magic-wormhole`](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole) - get things from one computer to another, safely\n- [`dcp`](https://github.com/tom-james-watson/dat-cp) - Remote file copy, powered by the Dat protocol.\n- [`iwant`](https://github.com/nirvik/iWant) - CLI based decentralized peer to peer file sharing\n- [`p2pcopy`](https://github.com/psantosl/p2pcopy) - Small command line application to do p2p file copy behind firewalls\n  without a central server.\n- [`zget`](https://github.com/nils-werner/zget) - Filename based peer to peer file transfer\n- [`sharedrop`](https://github.com/cowbell/sharedrop) - Easy P2P file transfer powered by WebRTC - inspired by Apple\n  AirDrop\n- [`filepizza`](https://github.com/kern/filepizza) - Peer-to-peer file transfers in your browser\n- [`toss`](https://github.com/zerotier/toss) - Dead simple LAN file transfers from the command line\n- Forgot yours?
