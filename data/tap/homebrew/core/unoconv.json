  "readme": "= Automated conversion and styling using LibreOffice\nDag Wieers <dag@wieers.com>\n\n== Unoconv is deprecated\n\nPlease note that there is a rewrite of Unoconv called \"Unoserver\":\nhttps://github.com/unoconv/unoserver/\n\nWe are running Unoserver successfully in production, and it's now the\nrecommended solution.\n\nUnoserver does not have all the features of Unoconv, which features it\nwill get depends on a combination of what people want, and if someone\nwants to implement it. \n\nUntil Unoserver has all the major features people need, Unoconv is in \nbugfix mode, there will be no major changes. Once Unoserver has the major\nfeatures of Unoconv, Unoconv will become unsupported.\n\n== Unoconv\n\nUniversal Office Converter (unoconv) is a command line tool to convert any\ndocument format that LibreOffice can import to any document format that\nLibreOffice can export. It makes use of the LibreOffice's UNO bindings for\nnon-interactive conversion of documents.\n\n_For practical reasons we mention LibreOffice, but OpenOffice is supported by\nunoconv as well._\n\n\n== Installing unoconv\nunoconv can be installed using packages coming from your distribution, or\nsimply by copying the unoconv python script to your system.\n\nIf you installed unoconv by hand, make sure you have the required LibreOffice\nor OpenOffice packages installed. A hard requirement is the UNO python bindings\nwhich are often inside a subpackage named +libreoffice-pyuno+ or\n+libobasis4.4-pyuno+.\n\nVarious sub-packages are needed for specific import or export filters, e.g.\nXML-based filters require the xsltfilter subpackage,\ne.g. +libobasis4.4-xsltfilter+.\n\nIMPORTANT: Neglecting these requirements will cause unoconv to fail with\nunhelpful and confusing error messages.\n\nTo find a good Python installation to use to run unoconv, do the following:\n\nTo find which Python to use to run unoconv, you can try a script I made.\n\n----\ncd /tmp\nwget -l https://gist.githubusercontent.com/regebro/036da022dc7d5241a0ee97efdf1458eb/raw/1bc0655423d196acd79a5d9fa60d2baada8dd534/find_uno.py\npython3 find_uno.py\n----\n\nIt should list all Pythons that have Libreoffice libraries installed.\n\n\n== How does unoconv work ?\nunoconv starts its own office instance (if it cannot find an existing\nlistener) that it then uses. There are some challenges to do this\ncorrectly, but in general this works fine.\n\nTypically you would convert an ODT document to PDF by running:\n\n    unoconv -f pdf some-file.odt\n\n\n== Start your own unoconv listener\nHowever, you can always start an instance yourself at the default port 2002\n(or specify another port with -p/--port) and after use you can tear it down:\n\n----\nunoconv --listener &\nsleep 20\nunoconv -f pdf *.odt\nunoconv -f doc *.odt\nunoconv -f html *.odt\nkill -15 %-\n----\n\nIt is also possible to use a listener or LibreOffice instance that accepts\nconnections on another system and use it from unoconv remotely. This\nway the conversion tasks are performed on a dedicated system instead\nof on the client system. This works only if you have a shared filesystem\nmounted at the same location.\n\n\n== Python and pyuno incompatibilities\nBeware that the pyuno python module needs to be compiled with the exact\nsame version of python that you are using to load it. A lot of people that\nrun into problems loading pyuno are actually using a precompiled LibreOffice\nthat they downloaded somewhere and is incompatible with the python version\non their system.\n\nTo solve this issue, the project's office suite ships with its own python\ninterpreter located in the 'program' directory, this one should work\nflawlessly.\n\nThe most recent unoconv works around this issue by automatically detecting\nincompatibilities, and restarting itself using a compatible python (the same\none that ships with LibreOffice).\n\nYou can influence the automatic detection by setting the +UNO_PATH+ environment\nvariable to point to an alternative LibreOffice installation, e.g.:\n\n    UNO_PATH=/opt/libreoffice4.4 unoconv -f pdf some-file.odt\n\nBut you can also force another python by using it to execute unoconv, e.g.:\n\n    /opt/libreoffice4.4/program/python.bin unoconv -f pdf some-file.odt\n\nor on macOS:\n\n    /Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/python unoconv -f pdf some-file.odt\n\nor on Windows:\n\n    C:\\Program Files (x86)\\LibreOffice 4.4\\program\\python.exe unoconv -f pdf some-file.odt\n\nTIP: If you plan to use unoconv extensively (or in an automated fashion) it\nis more efficient to use the correct python interpreter directly. Or event\nput it directly in the Shebang (the first line) of the unoconv script !\n\n\n== Using unoconv with no X display\nSince OpenOffice 2.3 you do not need an X display for starting ooffice.\nHowever you may need the openoffice.org-headless package from your\ndistribution. Since LibreOffice 2.4 nothing special is needed, running\nin headless mode does not require X.\n\nFor any older OpenOffice releases, remember that ooffice requires an X\ndisplay, even when using it in headless mode. One solution is to use Xvfb\nto create a headless X display for ooffice.\n\n - http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?t=11890\n - http://www.wonko.be/2008/01/09/running-openoffice-headless-on-debian\n - http://ward.vandewege.net/writings/200510auto_doc_conv/\n - http://www.artofsolving.com/node/10\n\n\n== Using unoconv with macOS\nLibreOffice 3.6.0.1 or later is required to use unoconv under macOS.  This\nis the first version distributed with an internal python script that works.\nNo version of OpenOffice for macOS (3.4 is the current version) works because\nthe necessary internal files are not included inside the application.\n\n\n== Problems running unoconv from Nginx/Apache/PHP\nSome people have had difficulties using unoconv through webservices. Here\nis a list of probable causes and recommendations:\n\n - Use the latest version of unoconv (or GitHub master branch)\n\n - Use the most recent stable release of LibreOffice (less memory, more stable, fewer crashes)\n\n - Use the native LibreOffice python binary to run unoconv\n\n - Hardcode this native python path in the unoconv script shebang (or ensure PATH is set)\n\n - Ensure that the user running unoconv has write access to its HOME directory (ensure HOME is set)\n\n - Test with SELinux in permissive mode\n\nIt is recommended to open the unoconv script and modify the very first line to\npoint directly to your installed LibreOffice python binary, so replace this:\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env python\n\nwith something like this:\n\n    #!/opt/libreoffice4.4/program/python\n\n== Conversion problems\nIf you encounter problems converting files, it often helps to try again. If\nyou are using a listener, restarting the listener may help as well.\n\nThe reason for conversion failures are unclear, and they are not\ndeterministic. unoconv is not the only project to have noticed problems\nwith import and export filters using PyUNO. We assume these are related\nto internal state or timing issues that under certain conditions fail\nto correctly work.\n\nIf you can reproduce the problem on a specific file, please take the time to\nopen the file in LibreOffice directly and export it to the desired format. If\nthis fails, it needs to be reported to the LibreOffice project directly. If\nthat works, we need to know !\n\nWe are looking into this with the LibreOffice developers to:\n\n - Collaborate closer to find, report and fix unexpected failures\n - Allow end-users to increase debugging and improve reporting to the project\n\n\n== Troubleshooting instructions\nIf you encounter a problem with converting documents using unoconv, please\nconsider that this could be caused by a number of things:\n\n - incomplete LibreOffice installation\n - LibreOffice bug or regression specific to your version/distribution\n - LibreOffice import or export filter issue\n - problem related to stale lock files\n - problem related to the source document\n - problem related to permissions or SELinux\n - problem related to the python UNO bindings\n - problem related to the unoconv python script\n\nIt is recommended to follow all of the below steps to pinpoint the problem:\n\n - if this is the first time you are using LibreOffice/OpenOffice, make sure\n   you have all the required sub-packages installed, depending on the\n   distribution this could be the +xsltfilter+, +headless+, +writer+,\n   +calc+, +impress+ or +draw+ sub-packages.\n\n - check if there is no existing LibreOffice process running on the system\n   that could interfere with proper functioning\n\n        # pgrep -l 'office|writer|calc'\n\n - check that there are no stale lock files present, e.g. '.~lock.file.pdf#' or\n   '.~lock.index.html#'\n\n - check that the LibreOffice instance handling UNO requests is not handling\n   multiple requests at the same time\n\n - try using the latest unoconv release, or the latest version on Github at:\n   https://github.com/dagwieers/unoconv/downloads\n\n - try the conversion by opening the file in LibreOffice and exporting\n   it through LibreOffice directly\n\n - try unoconv with a different minor or major LibreOffice version to test\n   whether it is a regression in LibreOffice\n\n - try to load the UNO bindings in python manually:\n\n   * do this with the python executable that ships with the LibreOffice\n     package/installer\n\n        # /opt/libreoffice4.4/program/python.bin -c 'import uno, unohelper'\n\n   * or alternatively, run the distribution python (with the distribution\n     LibreOffice)\n\n        # python -c 'import uno, unohelper'\n\n - try unoconv with a different python interpreter manually:\n\n    # /opt/libreoffice4.4/program/python.bin unoconv -f pdf test-file.odt\n\nIf you tried all of the above, and the issue still remains, the issue might\nstill be related to import/export filters, LibreOffice or unoconv, so please\nreport any information to reproduce the problem on the Github issue-tracker\nat: https://github.com/dagwieers/unoconv/issues\n\nAnd do mention that you already tried the above hints to troubleshoot the issue.\n\n\n== Interesting information\nIf you're interested to help out with development, here are some pointers to\ninteresting sources:\n\n - [Tutorial] Import uno module to a different Python install\n   http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=36370&p=166783\n\n - UDK: UNO Development Kit\n   http://udk.openoffice.org/\n\n - Python-UNO bridge\n   http://www.openoffice.org/udk/python/python-bridge.html\n\n - Python and OpenOffice.org\n   http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Python\n\n - OpenOffice.org developer manual\n   http://api.openoffice.org/DevelopersGuide/DevelopersGuide.html\n\n - Framework/Article/Filter/FilterList OOo 2 1\n   http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Framework/Article/Filter/FilterList_OOo_2_1\n\n - Framework/Article/Filter/FilterList OOo 3 0\n   http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Framework/Article/Filter/FilterList_OOo_3_0\n\n\n== Other implementations\nOther implementations using python and UNO:\n\n - unoserver\n   https://github.com/unoconv/unoserver/\n   \n\n - convwatch\n   http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/tree/bin/convwatch.py\n\n - oooconv\n   https://svn.infrae.com/oooconv/trunk/src/oooconv/filters.py\n\n - officeshots.org\n   http://code.officeshots.org/trac/officeshots/browser/trunk/factory/src/backends/oooserver.py\n\n - cloudooo\n   http://svn.erp5.org/erp5/trunk/utils/cloudooo.handler/ooo/cloudooo/handler/ooo/\n\n\n== Related tools\nOther tools that are useful or similar in operation:\n\n - Text based document generation:\n   http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/\n\n - DocBook to OpenDocument XSLT:\n   http://open.comsultia.com/docbook2odf/\n\n - Simple (and stupid) converter from OpenDocument Text to plain text:\n   http://stosberg.net/odt2txt/\n\n - Another python tool to aid in converting files using UNO:\n   http://www.artofsolving.com/files/DocumentConverter.py\n   http://www.artofsolving.com/opensource/pyodconverter"
