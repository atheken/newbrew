  "readme": "#+TITLE: README for Recode\n#+OPTIONS: H:2 toc:2\n\n* Introduction\n** What is Recode?\nThe Recode library converts files between character sets and usages.\nIt recognises or produces over 200 different character sets (or about\n300 if combined with an *iconv* library) and transliterates files\nbetween almost any pair.  When exact transliteration are not possible,\nit gets rid of offending characters or falls back on approximations.\nThe *recode* program is a handy front-end to the library.\n\nGlance through this =README= file before starting configuration.  Make\nsure you read files =ABOUT-NLS= and =INSTALL= if you are not familiar with\nthem already.\n\nThe Recode program and library have been written by Fran√ßois Pinard,\nyet it significantly reuses tabular works from Keld Simonsen.  It is\nan evolving package, and specifications might change in future\nreleases.\n\nOn various Unix systems, Recode is usually compiled from sources, see\nthe [[Installation]] section below.  On Linux, it often comes bundled.\nRecode had been ported to other popular systems.  See both\n[[http:/contrib.html][contrib/README]] and the [[Non-Unix ports]] section below, to find some more\ninformation about these.\n\n** Reports and collaboration\nPlease file bug reports as [[https://github.com/rrthomas/Recode/issues][GitHub Issues]].  If you cannot use GitHub, do\nwrite directly to [[mailto:rrt@sc3d.org]] A bug report is an adequate\ndescription of the problem: your input, what you expected, what you got, and\nwhy this is wrong.  Patches are welcome, but they only describe a solution,\nfrom which the problem might be uneasy to infer.  If needed, submit actual\ndata files with your report.\n\nYour feedback will help us to make a better and more portable package.\nConsider documentation errors as bugs, and report them as such.  If\nyou develop anything pertaining to Recode or have suggestions, please\nshare them on GitHub.\n\nThe [[https://github.com/rrthomas/Recode][Git repository]] for Recode gives access, through the magic of Git and\nGitHub, to all distribution releases, be they actual or past, pretest or\nofficial, as well as individual files.\n\n* Installation\n** In a hurry?\nSee =INSTALL=. (For installing from git, see =HACKING.org=.)\n\nMore fine-grained instructions follow.\n\n** Prerequisites\nSimple installation of Recode requires the usual tools and facilities as\nthose needed for most GNU packages.  If not already bundled with your\nsystem, you also need to install [[https://www.python.org][Python]], version 3.5 or later.\n\nIt is also convenient to have some *iconv* library already present on your\nsystem, this much extends Recode capabilities, especially in the area of\nAsiatic character sets.  GNU *libc*, as found on Linux systems and a few\nothers, already has such an *iconv* library.  Otherwise, you might consider\ninstalling the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/][portable libiconv]], written by Bruno Haible.\n\n** Getting a release\nSource files and various distributions (either latest, prestest, or\narchive) are available through [[https://github.com/rrthomas/Recode/][GitHub]].\n\n** Configure options\nOnce you have an unpacked distribution, see files:\n\n  |-------------+------------------------------------------------|\n  | File name   | Description                                    |\n  |-------------+------------------------------------------------|\n  | =ABOUT-NLS=   | how to customise this program to your language |\n  | =COPYING=     | copying conditions for the program             |\n  | =COPYING.LIB= | copying conditions for the library             |\n  | =INSTALL=     | compilation and installation instructions      |\n  | =NEWS=        | major changes in the current release           |\n  | =THANKS=      | partial list of contributors                   |\n  |-------------+------------------------------------------------|"
