It is forked off of Chocolate Doom to take advantage of its free and open-source code base, portability, accuracy and compatibility with Vanilla Doom.\n\nIts core features are:\n\n * Enhanced 640x400 display resolution, with the original 320x200 resolution still available in the \"High Resolution Rendering: Off\" mode.\n * Widescreen rendering for using all the available horizontal space of screens with aspect ratios up to 24:9.\n * Uncapped rendering framerate with interpolation and optional vertical synchronization (VSync) with the screen refresh rate.\n * Intermediate gamma correction levels (0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5).\n * Removal of all static engine limits, or at least raising of the less crucial ones.\n * Full support for the \"Doom Classic\" WADs shipped with the \"Doom 3: BFG Edition\", especially the \"No Rest For The Living\" episode shipped in the NERVE.WAD file.\n * Support for all versions of John Romero's Episode 5: Sigil for Ultimate Doom.\n\nFurthermore, the following optional user-visible and audible features are available:\n\n * Jumping.\n * Free vertical looking, including mouse look and vertical aiming.\n * Aiming support by a crosshair that may get directly rendered into the game world.\n * A new minimal Crispy HUD, displaying only the status bar numbers.\n * Clean Screenshot feature, enabling to take screenshots without HUD elements and even without status bar numbers and weapon sprites at higher screen sizes.\n * Colorized status bar numbers, HUD texts and blood sprites for certain monsters.\n * Translucency for certain sprites and status bar elements in the Crispy HUD.\n * Randomly mirrored death animations and corpse sprites.\n * Command line options to allow for playing with flipped player weapon sprites and/or entirely flipped level geometry.\n * Players may walk over or under monsters and hanging corpses.\n * Centered Weapons when firing, weapon recoil thrust and pitch.\n * Reports whenever a secret is revealed.\n * Level statistics and extended coloring in the Automap.\n * Playing sounds in full length, and misc. other sound fixes.\n * Demo recording and/or playback timers and progress bar.\n * Demo continue and take-over features, handing controls over to the player when demo playback is finished or interrupted.\n\nMost of these features are disabled by default and need to get enabled either in the in-game \"Crispness\" menu, in the crispy-doom-setup tool or as command line parameters. They are implemented in a way that preserves demo-compatibility with Vanilla Doom and network game compatibility with Chocolate Doom. Furthermore, Crispy Doom's savegames and config files are compatible, though not identical (see the [Compatibility section in the Wiki](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom/wiki/Compatibility), to Vanilla Doom's. \n\nCrispy Doom strives for maximum compatibility with all \"limit-removing Vanilla\" maps -- but not Boom or ZDoom maps. More specifically, Crispy Doom supports some select advanced features such as [ANIMATED](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ANIMATED) and [SWITCHES](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/SWITCHES) lumps, MBF sky transfers, SMMU swirling flats and [MUSINFO](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MUSINFO) -- but neither generalized linedef and sector types nor DECORATE and MAPINFO.\n\nMany additional less user-visible features have been implemented, e.g. fixed engine limitations and crashes, fixed rendering bugs, fixed harmless game logic bugs, full support for DEHACKED files and lumps in BEX format, additional and improved cheat codes, an improved Automap, and many more! Due to the extra DEHACKED states added from [MBF](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MBF), Crispy Doom supports [enhancer](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/84859-black-ops-smooth-weapons-dehacked-mod) [mods](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/85991-smoothed-smooth-monsters-for-doom-retro-and-crispy-doom) that can make the gameplay even more pleasing to the eyes. For a detailed list of features and changes please refer to the release notes below.\n\n## Download\n\n* Windows: [Get binaries of the latest release](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom/releases/latest), compatible with both x86 and x64 editions.\n* MacOS: Use MacPorts: `sudo port install crispy-doom` or Homebrew: `brew install crispy-doom`.\n* Linux: To install on Ubuntu (“Eoan Ermine” 19.10 and later)/Debian (“Buster” 10 and later) based systems: `sudo apt-get install crispy-doom`\n\n\nThe most recent list of changes can be found in the [Changelog](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\nA complete history of changes and releases can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom/wiki/Changelog-History) or on the [Releases](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom/releases) page.\n\nDaily builds of Crispy Doom can be found here:\nhttp://latest.chocolate-doom.org/\n\nCrispy Doom can play nearly all variants of Doom. If you don't own any, you may download the [Shareware version of Doom](http://cdn.debian.net/debian/pool/non-free/d/doom-wad-shareware/doom-wad-shareware_1.9.fixed.orig.tar.gz), extract it and copy the DOOM1.WAD file into your Crispy Doom directory. Alternatively, you may want to play Crispy Doom with [Freedoom](https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Freedoom) and a MegaWAD.\n### Sources\n[![Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/crispy-doom/widgets/project_thin_badge?style=flat&format=gif)](https://www.openhub.net/p/crispy-doom)\n\nThe Crispy Doom source code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom.\nIt can be [downloaded in either ZIP or TAR.GZ format](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom/releases) \nor cloned via\n\n```\n git clone https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom.git\n```\n\n\n * Brief instructions to set up a build system on Windows can be found [in the Crispy Doom Wiki](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom/wiki/Building-on-Windows).

However, his fork aims at a different direction and I did not take a single line of code from it. Lee Killough's [MBF](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/WinMBF) was studied and used to debug the code, especially in the form of Team Eternity's [WinMBF](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/WinMBF) source port, which made it easier to compile and run on my machine. And of course there is fraggle's [Chocolate Doom](https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom) with its exceptionally clean and legible source code. Please let me take this opportunity to appreciate all these authors for their work!\n\nAlso, thanks to plums of the [Doomworld forums](https://www.doomworld.com/vb/) for beta testing, \"release manager\" SoDOOManiac and \"art director\" JNechaevsky for the continuous flow of support and inspiration during the post-3.x development cycle and (last but not the least) [Cacodemon9000](http://www.moddb.com/members/cacodemon9000) for his [Infested Outpost](http://www.moddb.com/games/doom-ii/addons/infested-outpost) map that helped to track down quite a few bugs!\n\nFurthermore, thanks to VGA for his aid with adding support for his two mods: [PerK & NightFright's Black Ops smooth weapons add-on converted to DEHACKED](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/84859-black-ops-smooth-weapons-dehacked-mod) and [Gifty's Smooth Doom smooth monster animations converted to DEHACKED](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/85991-smoothed-smooth-monsters-for-doom-retro-and-crispy-doom) that can make the gameplay even more pleasing to the eyes.\n\n## Legalese\n\nDoom is © 1993-1996 Id Software, Inc.; \nBoom 2.02 is © 1999 id Software, Chi Hoang, Lee Killough, Jim Flynn, Rand Phares, Ty Halderman;\nPrBoom+ is © 1999 id Software, Chi Hoang, Lee Killough, Jim Flynn, Rand Phares, Ty Halderman,\n© 1999-2000 Jess Haas, Nicolas Kalkhof, Colin Phipps, Florian Schulze,\n© 2005-2006 Florian Schulze, Colin Phipps, Neil Stevens, Andrey Budko;\nChocolate Doom is © 1993-1996 Id Software, Inc., © 2005 Simon Howard; \nChocolate Hexen is © 1993-1996 Id Software, Inc., © 1993-2008 Raven Software, © 2008 Simon Howard;\nStrawberry Doom is © 1993-1996 Id Software, Inc., © 2005 Simon Howard, © 2008-2010 GhostlyDeath; \nCrispy Doom is additionally © 2014-2019 Fabian Greffrath;\nall of the above are released under the [GPL-2+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).\n\nSDL 2.0, SDL_mixer 2.0 and SDL_net 2.0 are © 1997-2016 Sam Lantinga and are released under the [zlib license](http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_license.html).\n\nSecret Rabbit Code (libsamplerate) is © 2002-2011 Erik de Castro Lopo and is released under the [GPL-2+](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).\nLibpng is © 1998-2014 Glenn Randers-Pehrson, © 1996-1997 Andreas Dilger, © 1995-1996 Guy Eric Schalnat, Group 42, Inc. and is released under the [libpng license](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/src/libpng-LICENSE.txt).\nZlib is © 1995-2013 Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler and is released under the [zlib license](http://www.zlib.net/zlib_license.html).\n\nThe Crispy Doom icon (as shown at the top of this page) has been contributed by [Philip Kiwan](https://www.github.com/kiwphi)."
