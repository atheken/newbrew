  "readme": "rbenv-chefdk: Use ChefDK with rbenv\n===================================\n\nThis plugin lets you treat [ChefDK](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/) as\nanother version in [rbenv](http://rbenv.org/).\n\n**deprecated** ChefDK has been replaced by Chef Workstation. See the [rbenv-chef-workstation](https://github.com/docwhat/rbenv-chef-workstation) plugin instead.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n-   [ChefDK](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/) installed in `/opt/chefdk`\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n### From GitHub\n\nTo install rbenv-chefdk, clone this repository into the `$(rbenv root)/plugins`\ndirectory.\n\n``` sh\ncd $(rbenv root)/plugins\ngit clone <url>\n```\n\n### On macOS\n\nOn macOS, you can use [`brew`](https://brew.sh/) to install:\n```\nbrew install rbenv-chefdk\n```\n\n**Warning:** If you've previously installed ChefDK which led you to using this\nplugin, you will want to remove the profile changes recommended in the [ChefDK\ninstall instructions](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html#set-system-ruby) or\nin the Homebrew info gist. Otherwise `rbenv` or ChefDK will not work correctly.\n\nThen create an empty directory in `$(rbenv root)/versions` called `chefdk`:\n\n``` sh\n$ mkdir \"$(rbenv root)/versions/chefdk\"\n```\n\nFinally, change to the new `chefdk` version and run `rbenv rehash`.\n\n``` sh\n$ rbenv shell chefdk\n$ rbenv rehash\n$ rbenv which ruby\n/opt/chefdk/embedded/bin/ruby\n```\n\nThat's it!\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\nIf you are having problems, try running `sanity-check.sh`:\n\n``` sh\n$ $SHELL \"$(rbenv root)/plugins/rbenv-chefdk/sanity-check.sh\"\n```\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n### Hey, what happened to `gem`?\n\nWith the ChefDK you have to use `chef gem` instead.\n\n### Why don't you include `/opt/chefdk/embedded/bin`?\n\nWe don't fully include the `/opt/chefdk/embedded/bin` directory because it'll\nbreak your system in subtle ways.\n\n`/opt/chefdk/embedded/bin` has commands like `clear`, `tput`, `xsltproc`, and\n`xz`. These are commands that are part of your system and are only included in\nChefDK so it gets reliable results across platforms.\n\nIf we made shims of these commands, your system might break when not using\nchefdk and can produce unexpected results even if you were using chefdk if your\nversion of these commands are different (e.g. Gnu vs. BSD or version).\n\n### Why not just symlink `/opt/chefdk/embedded` to `$(rbenv root)/versions/chefdk`?\n\nFor the same reason we don't include `/opt/chefdk/embedded/bin`: It breaks\nsystems commands in unexpected ways.\n\n### Rbenv isn't working or is using gems from the wrong place\n\nMake sure you undid any changes recommended by the [ChefDK install\ninstructions](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html#set-system-ruby) or in the\nHomebrew info gist.\n\nSpecifically, make sure you aren't calling `chef shell-init` anyplace in your\nshell startup files.\n\n### \"can't find executable chef (Gem::Exception)\"\n\nThis is probably because you are using\n[`rbenv-bundle-exec`](https://github.com/maljub01/rbenv-bundle-exec).\n\nYou'll have to tell `rbenv-bundle-exec` to ignore a bunch of binaries that are\nonly in ChefDK:\n\n``` sh\necho chef >> ~/.no_bundle_exec\necho berks >> ~/.no_bundle_exec\n```\n\nQuestions?\n----------\n\nYou can reach me at [docwhat.org](https://docwhat.org/email/) or as docwhat on\n[Freenode IRC](https://freenode.net/).\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright (c) 2015,2016 Christian HÃ¶ltje - Released under the MIT License (see\nthe\n`LICENSE` file)\n\nNote on Patches/Pull Requests\n-----------------------------\n\n-   Fork the project.\n-   Make your feature addition or bug fix.\n-   Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future\n    version unintentionally.\n-   Commit\n-   Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches."
