(maybe with cygwin?)  \nI have successfully tested this on Ubuntu and macOS.  \nIf this won't work on your OS, [create a new issue](https://github.com/jomo/imgur-screenshot/issues/new?title=add+support+for+_______&body=required+steps+to+make+it+work+on+______:).\n\n\n## Note\n\nThe screenshot will be taken **after** the selection has been made. This might be annoying if you want to capture something quickly and _then_ want to select an area.\nHowever, you can take a full shot and use the edit option to crop the image before upload."
