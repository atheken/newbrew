[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/languitar/pass-git-helper/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/languitar/pass-git-helper)\n\n# pass-git-helper\n\nA [git] credential helper implementation that allows using [pass] as the credential backend for your https-based git repositories.\nWhen [git] tries to interact with an https-based upstream and needs credentials, this helper will be called to look up the credentials from the user's password store.\nInstead of enforcing a specific layout of the password store, a configuration file with explicitly defining mappings between hosts and entries in the password store is used, giving full flexibility to the user on how to structure or reuse existing password databases for [git] authentication.\npass-git-helper will use the mappings to find the correct entry in the user's password store based on the request URL and then provides [git] with the credentials from this entry.\n\n## Preconditions\n\nIt is recommended to configure GPG to use a graphical pinentry program.\nThat way, you can also use this helper when [git] is invoked via GUI programs such as your IDE.\nFor a configuration example, refer to the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GnuPG#pinentry).\nIn case you really want to use the terminal for pinentry (via `pinentry-curses`), be sure to [appropriately configure the environment variable `GPG_TTY`](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Invoking-GPG_002dAGENT.html), most likely by adding the following lines to your shell initialization:\n\n```sh\nGPG_TTY=$(tty)\nexport GPG_TTY\n```\n\nIf you use this setup for remote work via SSH, also consider the alternative of [GPG agent forwarding](https://wiki.gnupg.org/AgentForwarding).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Official Packages\n\nIf possible, use an available package for your Linux distribution or operating system such as the ones linked below.\n\n[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/pass-git-helper.svg)](https://repology.org/project/pass-git-helper/versions)\n\n### From Source\n\n```sh\nsudo pip install .\n```\n\nThis might potentially install Python packages without the knowledge of your system's package manager.\nIf all package preconditions are already met, you can also copy the script file to to your system to avoid this problem:\n\n```sh\nsudo cp passgithelper.py /usr/local/bin/pass-git-helper\n```\n\nAnother option is to install the script in an isolated [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/):\n\n```sh\nvirtualenv /your/env\n/your/env/pip install .\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Configure git to use pass-git-helper\n\nTo instruct git to use the helper, set the `credential.helper` configuration option of git to `/full/path/to/pass-git-helper`.\nIn case you do not want to include a full path, a workaround using a shell fragment needs to be used, i.e. `!pass-git-helper $@` must be the option value.\nThe option can be set using the CLI with:\n\n```sh\ngit config credential.helper '!pass-git-helper $@'\n```\n\nThis will result in the following contents in `~/.gitconfig`:\n\n```ini\n[credential]\n    helper = !pass-git-helper $@\n```\n\nIn case you share the `~/.gitconfig` across multiple machines and `pass-git-helper` is not available on all of them, the following version does not bail out if pass git helper is missing:\n\n```ini\n[credential]\n    helper = !type pass-git-helper >/dev/null && pass-git-helper $@\n```\n\n`pass-git-helper` can be combined with other helpers.\nFor instance, the following configuration first tries the git built-in `cache` helper for in-memory password access before falling back to `pass-git-helper` if a cache miss occurs:\n\n```ini\n[credential]\n    helper = cache\n    helper = !type pass-git-helper >/dev/null && pass-git-helper$@\n```\n\n### Define Mappings\n\nCreate the file `~/.config/pass-git-helper/git-pass-mapping.ini`.\nThis file uses ini syntax to specify the mapping of hosts to entries in the password store database.\nThe first matching mapping from the configuration file is used to select the entry from the password store database.\nThis search process is based on the order of definition in the configuration file.\n\nSection headers define patterns which are matched against the host part of a URL with a git repository.\nMatching supports wildcards (using the python [fnmatch module](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/fnmatch.html)).\n\nEach section needs to contain a `target` entry pointing to the entry in the password store with the password (and optionally username) to use.\n\nExample:\n\n```ini\n[github.com*]\ntarget=dev/github\n\n[*.fooo-bar.*]\ntarget=dev/fooo-bar\n```\n\nIf you want to match entries not only based on the host, but also based on the path on a host, set `credential.useHttpPath` to `true` in your git config, e.g. via:\n\n```sh\ngit config credential.useHttpPath true\n```\n\nAfterwards, entries can be matched against `host.com/path/to/repo` in the mapping.\nThis means that in order to use a specific account for a certain Github project, you can then use the following mapping pattern:\n\n```ini\n[github.com/username/project*]\ntarget=dev/github\n```\n\nPlease note that when including the path in the mapping, the mapping expressions need to match against the whole path.\nAs a consequence, in case you want to use the same account for all Github projects, you need to make sure that a wildcard covers the path of the URL, as shown here:\n\n```ini\n[github.com*]\ntarget=dev/github\n```\n\nThe host can be used as a variable to address a pass entry.\nThis is especially helpful for wildcard matches:\n\n```ini\n[*]\ntarget=git-logins/${host}\n```\n\nThe above configuration directive will lead to any host that did not match any previous section in the ini file to being looked up under the `git-logins` directory in your password store.\n\n#### DEFAULT Section\n\nDefaults suitable for all entries of the mapping file can be specified in a special section of the configuration file named `[DEFAULT]`.\nEverything configure in this section will automatically be available for all further entries in the file, but can be overridden there, too.\n\n### Using Different Mappings Depending on the Working Directory\n\nUsing the `includeIf` directive available in git >= 2.13, it is possible to perform matching based on the current working directory by invoking `pass-git-helper` with a conditional `MAPPING-FILE`.\nTo achieve this, edit your `.gitconfig`, e.g. like this:\n\n```ini\n[includeIf \"gitdir:~/src/user1/\"]\n    path=~/.config/git/gitconfig_user1\n[includeIf \"gitdir:~/src/user2/\"]\n    path=~/.config/git/gitconfig_user2\n```\n\nWith the following contents of `gitconfig_user1` (and `gitconfig_user2` respectively), `mapping_user1.ini`, which could contain a `target` entry to e.g. `github.com/user1` would always be invoked in `~/src/user1`:\n\n```ini\n[user]\n    name = user1\n[credential]\n    helper=/full/path/to/pass-git-helper -m /full/path/to/mapping_user1.ini\n```\n\nSee also the official [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_includes) for `.gitconfig`.\n\n### Switching Password Stores per Mapping\n\nTo select a different password store for certain entries, the `password_store_dir` configuration key can be set.\nIf set, `pass` is directed to a different data directory by defining the `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR` environment variable when calling `pass`.\n\nThe following config demonstrates this practices\n\n```init\n[github.com/mycompany]\npassword_store_dir=/home/me/.work-passwords\n```\n\n## Password Store Layout and Data Extraction\n\n### Password\n\nAs usual with [pass], this helper assumes that the password is contained in the first line of the password store entry.\nThough uncommon, it is possible to strip a prefix from the data of the first line (such as `password:` by specifying an amount of characters to leave out in the `skip_password` field for an entry or also in the `[DEFAULT]` section to apply for all entries:\n\n```ini\n[DEFAULT]\n# length of \"password: \"\nskip_password=10\n\n[somedomain]\n# for some reasons, this entry doesn't have a password prefix\nskip_password=0\ntarget=special/noprefix\n```\n\n### Username\n\n`pass-git-helper` can also provide the username necessary for authenticating at a server.\nIn contrast to the password, no clear convention exists how username information is stored in password entries.\nTherefore, multiple strategies to extract the username are implemented and can be selected globally for the whole password store in the `[DEFAULT]` section, or individually for certain entries using the `username_extractor` key:\n\n```ini\n[DEFAULT]\nusername_extractor=regex_search\nregex_username=^user: (.*)$\n\n[differingdomain.com]\n# use a fixed line here instead of a regex search\nusername_extractor=specific_line\nline_username=1\n```\n\nThe following strategies can be configured:\n\n#### Strategy \"specific_line\" (default)\n\nExtracts the data from a line indexed by its line number.\nOptionally a fixed-length prefix can be stripped before returning the line contents.\n\nConfiguration:\n\n* `line_username`: Line number containing the username, **0-based**. Default: 1 (second line)\n* `skip_username`: Number of characters to skip at the beginning of the line, for instance to skip a `user:` prefix. Similar to `skip_password`. Default: 0.\n\n#### Strategy \"regex_search\"\n\nSearches for the first line that matches a provided regular expressions and returns the contents of that line that are captured in a regular expression capture group.\n\nConfiguration:\n\n* `regex_username`: The regular expression to apply. Has to contain a single capture group for indicating the data to extract. Default: `^username: +(.*)$`.\n\n#### Strategy \"entry_name\"\n\nReturns the last path fragment of the password store entry as the username.\nFor instance, if a regular [pass] call would be `pass show dev/github.com/languitar`, the returned username would be `languitar`.\n\nNo configuration options.\n\n### File Encoding\n\nBy default, password store entries are assumed to use UTF-8 encoding.\nIf all or some of your entries use a different encoding, use the `encoding` key (for instance, in the `DEFAULT` section) to specify the used encoding.\n\n## Command Line Options\n\n`-l` can be given as an option to the script to produce logging output on stderr.\nThis might be useful to understand how the mapping is applied.\n\n`-m MAPPING_FILE` can be specified to use an alternative mapping file location.\n\n## Skipping Processing\n\nIn some automated contexts it might be necessary to prevent GPG from asking for the passphrase (via the agent).\nTo achieve this, you can disable the complete processing of this helper by defining the environment variable `PASS_GIT_HELPER_SKIP` with any content (or no content at all).\npass-git-helper will return immediately in this case, indicating to git that no suitable credentials could be found.\n\n## License\n\nThis library is [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software); you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the [GNU Lesser General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License) as published by the [Free Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation); either version 3 of the License, or any later version.
