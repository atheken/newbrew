There are only just a few left. I want to still maintain and develop sc-im, but I am the only income in my family and its becoming difficult to work as much as I would want.\nIf you can make a donation (see at the bottom), please do. Your help would be really appreciated!!\nThanks.\n\n# sc-im\nSpreadsheet Calculator Improvised, aka sc-im, is an ncurses based, vim-like spreadsheet calculator.\n\nsc-im is based on [sc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sc_(spreadsheet_calculator)), whose original authors are James Gosling and Mark Weiser, and mods were later added by Chuck Martin.\n\n## Some of the features of sc-im\n\n- Vim movements commands for editing cell content.\n- UNDO / REDO.\n- 65.536 rows and 702 columns supported. (The number of rows can be expanded to 1.048.576 if wished).\n- CSV / TAB delimited / XLSX file import and export. ODS import. Markdown export.\n- Key-mappings.\n- Autobackup.\n- Direct color support - specifing the RGB values, screen colors can be customized by user, even at runtime.\n- Colorize cells or give them format such as bold, italic or underline.\n- Wide character support. The following alphabets are supported: English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Russian, Ukrainian, Greek, Turkish, Czech, Japanese, Chinese.\n- Sort of rows.\n- Filter of rows.\n- Subtotals.\n- Cell shifting.\n- Clipboard support.\n- GNUPlot interaction.\n- Scripting support with LUA. Also with triggers and c dynamic linked modules.\n- Implement external functions in the language you prefer and use them in SC-IM.\n- Use SC-IM as a non-interactive calculator, reading its input from an external script.\n\n\n## Quick start\n\n|        Key       |                 Purpose                 |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|         =        | Insert a numeric value                  |\n|         \\        | Insert a text value                     |\n|         e        | Edit a numeric value                    |\n|         E        | Edit a string value                     |\n|         x        | Delete current cell content             |\n|        :q        | Quit the app                            |\n|        :h        | See help                                |\n|  :w filename.sc  | Save current spreadsheet in sc format   |\n|         j        | Move down                               |\n|         k        | Move up                                 |\n|         h        | Move left                               |\n|         l        | Move right                              |\n|      goab12      | go to cell AB12                         |\n|         u        | undo last change                        |\n|        C-r       | redo last change undone                 |\n|        yy        | Copy current cell                       |\n|         v        | select a range using cursor/hjkl keys   |\n|         p        | paste a previously yanked cell or range |\n|        ir        | insert row                              |\n|        ic        | insert column                           |\n|        dr        | delete row                              |\n|        dc        | delete column                           |\n\n## Screenshots\n![demo image](screenshots/scim6.png?raw=true)\n![demo image](screenshots/scim-plot-graph.gif?raw=true)\n![demo image](screenshots/scim5.png?raw=true)\n![demo image](screenshots/scim4.png?raw=true)\n![demo image](screenshots/scimp2.png?raw=true)\n![demo image](screenshots/scimp3.png?raw=true)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* Requirements:\n\n  - `ncurses` (best if compiled with wide chars support)\n  - `bison` or `yacc`\n  - `gcc`\n  - `make`\n  - `pkg-config` and `which` (for make to do its job)\n\n* Optionals:\n\n  - `tmux` / `xclip` / `pbpaste` (for clipboard copy/paste)\n  - `gnuplot` (for plots)\n  - `libxlsxreader` (for xls support)\n  - `xlsxwriter` (for xlsx export support)\n  - `libxml-2.0` and `libzip` (for xlsx/ods import support)\n  - `lua` (for Lua scripting)\n  - threads support (in case you want to test this in Minix, just disable autobackup and HAVE_PTHREAD)\n\n### Manual\n\n* Edit [`src/Makefile`](src/Makefile) according to your system and needs:\n```\n    vim src/Makefile\n```\n\n* Run `make`:\n```\n    make -C src\n```\n\n* Optional: You can install the binary `sc-im` in your system by typing with a privileged user:\n```\n    make -C src install\n```\n\n### Building on OS X\n\nYou can follow the instructions as above, but if you would like Lua scripting\nsupport, you will need to install Lua 5.1, which you can do with,\n\n```\n    brew install lua@5.1\n```\n\nAnd then follow the instructions as above.\n\n### Homebrew for OSX users\n\n```\nbrew install sc-im\n```\n\n### Ubuntu with XLSX import & export\n\nSee [this wiki page](https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im/wiki/Ubuntu-with-XLSX-import-&-export).\n\n### Other distros / OS\n\nPlease check [wiki pages](https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im/wiki/)\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe `scimrc` file can be used to configure `sc-im`. The file should be placed in the `~/.config/sc-im` directory.\n\nHere is an example `~/.config/sc-im/scimrc` :\n\n    set autocalc\n    set numeric\n    set numeric_decimal=0\n    set overlap\n    set xlsx_readformulas\n\nOther configuration variables are listed in the [help file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andmarti1424/sc-im/freeze/src/doc).\n\n### Issues and questions\nPlease open an issue if you find a bug.\nIf you are now sure if its a bug, please take a look at the discussions and/or ask there.\nIf you have a question please check out current discussions and if you still are in doubt, open a discussion as well.\nIf you want to ask for a feature request, the same, check out current discussions.\nThank you!\n\n### Tutorial\n\n[sc-im tutorial](https://github.com/jonnieey/Sc-im-Tutorial)\n\n### Related projects\n\n- [vim-scimark](https://github.com/mipmip/vim-scimark) - Vim plugin, edit embedded markdown tables with sc-im in vim terminal.\n\n### Helping us\n\nWant to help?  You can help us with one or more of the following:\n\n* giving sc-im a star on GitHub\n* taking screenshots / creating screencasts showing sc-im\n* making a donation (see below).\n* telling if you use it / like it. I really don't have a clue if this app is used by someone.\n\n### Donations\n\nIf you like sc-im please support its development by making a DONATION with Patreon or PayPal.\nIt would really help a lot.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=U537V8SNQQ45J\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif\" />\n</a>\n\nIf you wish to make a donation, please click the above button or just send money to scim.spreadsheet@gmail.com via PayPal, choosing \"Goods and Services\".\nor with Patreon.\n\nThank you!"
