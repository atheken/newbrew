Released to the PD by Infocom. Includes \nsource files, headers, and information.\n\n```\n$ make\n```\n\n## History of the C Implementation of Dungeon\n\nThis version of dungeon has been modified from FORTRAN to C.  The\noriginal was written in DEC FORTRAN, translated from MDL.  It was then\ntranslated to f77 for UN*X systems, from which it was translated to C.\nThe C translation was done with the help of f2c, the FORTRAN to C\ntranslator written by David Gay (AT&T Bell Labs), Stu Feldman\n(Bellcore), Mark Maimone (Carnegie-Mellon University), and Norm\nSchryer (AT&T Bell Labs).\n\nI. From the original documentation...\n\nTo: Dungeon Players\nFrom: \"The Translator\"\nSubj: Game Information\nDate: 8-OCT-80\n\n\nThis is the first (and last) source release of the PDP-11 version of \nDungeon.\n\nPlease note that Dungeon has been superceded by the game ZORK(tm).\nThe following is an extract from the new product announcement for\nZORK in the September, 1980 issue of the RT-11 SIG newsletter:\n\n  \"'ZORK:  The Great Underground Empire - Part I' ...was developed\n   by the original authors based on their ZORK (Dungeon) game for\n   the PDP-10.  It features a greatly improved parser;  command\n   input and transcript output files;  SAVEs to any device and\n   file name;  and adaptation to different terminal types,\n   including a status line on VT100s.  Note:  this is not the\n   FORTRAN version that has been available through DECUS.  This\n   version has been completely rewritten to run efficiently on\n   small machines - up to 10 times as fast as the DECUS version.\n\n   ...ZORK runs under RT-ll, HT-ll, or RSTS/E and requires as\n   little as 20K words of memory and a single floppy disk drive.\n   The game package, consisting of an RX01-format diskette and\n   an instruction booklet, is available from Infocom, Inc.,\n   P.O. Box 120, Kendall Station, Cambridge, Ma. 02142.\"\n\nZORK(tm) is a trademark of Infocom, Inc.  It is available for several\npopular personal computers as well as for the PDP-ll.\n\n\n## Summary\n\n   Welcome to Dungeon!\n\n   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it\nyou will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal\nman.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained\nwithin.\n\n   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets\nof a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for\nvast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by\nfearsome monsters and diabolical traps!\n\n   No DECsystem should be without one!\n\n   Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT\nLaboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce\nDaniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of\nCrowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax\nand Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).\nThe current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by\na somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous.\n\n   On-line information may be obtained with the commands HELP and INFO.\n\nII. DEC FORTRAN to f77 Conversion (17-nov-81)\n\nThe conversion from DEC FORTRAN to Unix f77 was done by Randy\nDietrich, Lynn Cochran and Sig Peterson.  Much hacking was done to get\nit to fit in the limited address space of a PDP-11/44 (split I/D).\nSuffice it to say that by leaving out the debugging package and not\nlinking in the f77 i/o library they managed to get it to run.\n\nIII. PDP to VAX (dec-85)\n\nBased on the work of Randy, Lynn and Sig, Bill Randle folded in the\nfull save/restore functions and the game debugging package (gdt) into\nthe pdp version to create a Vax/Unix version.  This version also uses\nf77 i/o, thus eliminating the extra speak and listen processes needed\non the pdp.\n\nIV. Cleanup I (11-dec-86)\n\nJohn Gilmore (hoptoad!gnu) cleaned up the source files by moving\nmost of the common declarations into include files and added\ncomments from the original (FORTRAN or MDL?) source.  His efforts\nare greatly appreciated.\n\nV. Cleanup II (9-feb-87)\n\nBill Randle (billr@tekred.tek.com) added the pdp dependencies back\ninto the Vax source files with #ifdefs in order to have just one\nset of sources.  Previously, there were two sets of source: one for\nthe pdp and one for the Vax.  In addition, a shell escape of the\nform !cmd was added and the wizard can enter the gdt without having\nto recompile the source.  Finally, a man page was generated, based\non the dungeon.doc file.\n\nVI. f77 to C (11-mar-91)\n\nIan Lance Taylor (ian@airs.com or uunet!airs!ian) used the f2c\ntranslator to generate C source code.  The resulting code was modified\nto remove the FORTRAN I/O library, to add simple more processing, and\nto change the format of the database file.  Andre Srinivasan\n(andre@cs.pitt.edu) help test it.  Jonathan Mark\n(uunet!microsoft!jonm) made it work under MS-DOS and Microsoft C."
