Thanks for understanding.\n\n## Features\n\n- Support for serving local filesystem, encrypted local filesystem, S3 Compatible Object Storage, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage or other SFTP accounts over SFTP/SCP/FTP/WebDAV.\n- Virtual folders are supported: a virtual folder can use any of the supported storage backends. So you can have, for example, a user with the S3 backend mapping a GCS bucket (or part of it) on a specified path and an encrypted local filesystem on another one. Virtual folders can be private or shared among multiple users, for shared virtual folders you can define different quota limits for each user.\n- Configurable [custom commands and/or HTTP hooks](./docs/custom-actions.md) on upload, pre-upload, download, pre-download, delete, pre-delete, rename, mkdir, rmdir on SSH commands and on user add, update and delete.\n- Virtual accounts stored within a \"data provider\".\n- SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, Bolt (key/value store in pure Go) and in-memory data providers are supported.\n- Chroot isolation for local accounts. Cloud-based accounts can be restricted to a certain base path.\n- Per-user and per-directory virtual permissions, for each path you can allow or deny: directory listing, upload, overwrite, download, delete, rename, create directories, create symlinks, change owner/group/file mode and modification time.\n- [REST API](./docs/rest-api.md) for users and folders management, data retention, backup, restore and real time reports of the active connections with possibility of forcibly closing a connection.\n- The [Event Manager](./docs/eventmanager.md) allows to define custom workflows based on server events or schedules.\n- [Web based administration interface](./docs/web-admin.md) to easily manage users, folders and connections.\n- [Web client interface](./docs/web-client.md) so that end users can change their credentials, manage and share their files in the browser.\n- Public key and password authentication. Multiple public keys per-user are supported.\n- SSH user [certificate authentication](https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/src/usr.bin/ssh/PROTOCOL.certkeys?rev=1.8).\n- Keyboard interactive authentication. You can easily setup a customizable multi-factor authentication.\n- Partial authentication. You can configure multi-step authentication requiring, for example, the user password after successful public key authentication.\n- Per-user authentication methods.\n- [Two-factor authentication](./docs/howto/two-factor-authentication.md) based on time-based one time passwords (RFC 6238) which works with Authy, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator and other compatible apps.\n- LDAP/Active Directory authentication using a [plugin](https://github.com/sftpgo/sftpgo-plugin-auth).\n- Simplified user administrations using [groups](./docs/groups.md).\n- [Roles](./docs/roles.md) allow to create limited administrators who can only create and manage users with their role.\n- Custom authentication via [external programs/HTTP API](./docs/external-auth.md).\n- Web Client and Web Admin user interfaces support [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) authentication and so they can be integrated with identity providers such as [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/). You can find more details [here](./docs/oidc.md).\n- [Data At Rest Encryption](./docs/dare.md).\n- Dynamic user modification before login via [external programs/HTTP API](./docs/dynamic-user-mod.md).\n- Quota support: accounts can have individual disk quota expressed as max total size and/or max number of files.\n- Bandwidth throttling, with separate settings for upload and download and overrides based on the client's IP address.\n- Data transfer bandwidth limits, with total limit or separate settings for uploads and downloads and overrides based on the client's IP address. Limits can be reset using the REST API.\n- Per-protocol [rate limiting](./docs/rate-limiting.md) is supported and can be optionally connected to the built-in defender to automatically block hosts that repeatedly exceed the configured limit.\n- Per-user maximum concurrent sessions.\n- Per-user and global IP filters: login can be restricted to specific ranges of IP addresses or to a specific IP address.\n- Per-user and per-directory shell like patterns filters: files can be allowed, denied and optionally hidden based on shell like patterns.\n- Automatically terminating idle connections.\n- Automatic blocklist management using the built-in [defender](./docs/defender.md).\n- Geo-IP filtering using a [plugin](https://github.com/sftpgo/sftpgo-plugin-geoipfilter).\n- Atomic uploads are configurable.\n- Per-user files/folders ownership mapping: you can map all the users to the system account that runs SFTPGo (all platforms are supported) or you can run SFTPGo as root user and map each user or group of users to a different system account (\\*NIX only).\n- Support for Git repositories over SSH.\n- SCP and rsync are supported.\n- FTP/S is supported. You can configure the FTP service to require TLS for both control and data connections.\n- [WebDAV](./docs/webdav.md) is supported.\n- ACME protocol is supported. SFTPGo can obtain and automatically renew TLS certificates for HTTPS, WebDAV and FTPS from `Let's Encrypt` or other ACME compliant certificate authorities, using the `HTTP-01` or `TLS-ALPN-01` [challenge types](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/).\n- Two-Way TLS authentication, aka TLS with client certificate authentication, is supported for REST API/Web Admin, FTPS and WebDAV over HTTPS.\n- Per-user protocols restrictions. You can configure the allowed protocols (SSH/HTTP/FTP/WebDAV) for each user.\n- [Prometheus metrics](./docs/metrics.md) are supported.\n- Support for HAProxy PROXY protocol: you can proxy and/or load balance the SFTP/SCP/FTP service without losing the information about the client's address.\n- Easy [migration](./examples/convertusers) from Linux system user accounts.\n- [Portable mode](./docs/portable-mode.md): a convenient way to share a single directory on demand.\n- [SFTP subsystem mode](./docs/sftp-subsystem.md): you can use SFTPGo as OpenSSH's SFTP subsystem.\n- Performance analysis using built-in [profiler](./docs/profiling.md).\n- Configuration format is at your choice: JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, envfile are supported.\n- Log files are accurate and they are saved in the easily parsable JSON format ([more information](./docs/logs.md)).\n- SFTPGo supports a [plugin system](./docs/plugins.md) and therefore can be extended using external plugins.\n- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) support using the [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/drakkan/sftpgo/latest).\n\n## Platforms\n\nSFTPGo is developed and tested on Linux. After each commit, the code is automatically built and tested on Linux, macOS, Windows and FreeBSD. Other *BSD variants should work too.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Go as build only dependency. We support the Go version(s) used in [continuous integration workflows](./.github/workflows).\n- A suitable SQL server to use as data provider:\n  - upstream supported versions of PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB.\n  - CockroachDB stable.\n- The SQL server is optional: you can choose to use an embedded SQLite, bolt or in memory data provider.\n\n## Installation\n\nBinary releases for Linux, macOS, and Windows are available. Please visit the [releases](https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/releases \"releases\") page.\n\nAn official Docker image is available.

GitHub stores artifacts for 90 days.\n\nAlternately, you can [build from source](./docs/build-from-source.md).\n\n[Getting Started Guide for the Impatient](./docs/howto/getting-started.md).\n\n## Configuration\n\nA full explanation of all configuration methods can be found [here](./docs/full-configuration.md).\n\nPlease make sure to [initialize the data provider](#data-provider-initialization-and-management) before running the daemon.\n\nTo start SFTPGo with the default settings, simply run:\n\n```bash\nsftpgo serve\n```\n\nCheck out [this documentation](./docs/service.md) if you want to run SFTPGo as a service.\n\n### Data provider initialization and management\n\nBefore starting the SFTPGo server please ensure that the configured data provider is properly initialized/updated.\n\nFor PostgreSQL, MySQL and CockroachDB providers, you need to create the configured database. For SQLite, the configured database will be automatically created at startup. Memory and bolt data providers do not require an initialization but they could require an update to the existing data after upgrading SFTPGo.\n\nSFTPGo will attempt to automatically detect if the data provider is initialized/updated and if not, will attempt to initialize/ update it on startup as needed.\n\nAlternately, you can create/update the required data provider structures yourself using the `initprovider` command.\n\nFor example, you can simply execute the following command from the configuration directory:\n\n```bash\nsftpgo initprovider\n```\n\nTake a look at the CLI usage to learn how to specify a different configuration file:\n\n```bash\nsftpgo initprovider --help\n```\n\nYou can disable automatic data provider checks/updates at startup by setting the `update_mode` configuration key to `1`.\n\nYou can also reset your provider by using the `resetprovider` sub-command. Take a look at the CLI usage for more details:\n\n```bash\nsftpgo resetprovider --help\n```\n\n:warning: Please note that some data providers (e.g. MySQL and CockroachDB) do not support schema changes within a transaction, this means that you may end up with an inconsistent schema if migrations are forcibly aborted. CockroachDB doesn't support database-level locks, so make sure you don't execute migrations concurrently.\n\n## Create the first admin\n\nTo start using SFTPGo you need to create an admin user, you can do it in several ways:\n\n- by using the web admin interface. The default URL is [http://127.0.0.1:8080/web/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8080/web/admin)\n- by loading initial data\n- by enabling `create_default_admin` in your configuration file and setting the environment variables `SFTPGO_DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `SFTPGO_DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`\n\n## Upgrading\n\nSFTPGo supports upgrading from the previous release branch to the current one.\nSome examples for supported upgrade paths are:\n\n- from 2.1.x to 2.2.x\n- from 2.2.x to 2.3.x and so on.\n\nFor supported upgrade paths, the data and schema are migrated automatically when SFTPGo starts, alternatively you can use the `initprovider` command before starting SFTPGo.\n\nSo if, for example, you want to upgrade from 2.0.x to 2.2.x, you must first install version 2.1.x, update the data provider (automatically, by starting SFTPGo or manually using the `initprovider` command) and finally install the version 2.2.x. It is recommended to always install the latest available minor version, ie do not install 2.1.0 if 2.1.2 is available.\n\nLoading data from a provider independent JSON dump is supported from the previous release branch to the current one too. After upgrading SFTPGo it is advisable to regenerate the JSON dump from the new version.\n\n## Downgrading\n\nIf for some reason you want to downgrade SFTPGo, you may need to downgrade your data provider schema and data as well. You can use the `revertprovider` command for this task.\n\nAs for upgrading, SFTPGo supports downgrading from the previous release branch to the current one.\n\nSo, if you plan to downgrade from 2.3.x to 2.2.x, before uninstalling 2.3.x version, you can prepare your data provider executing the following command from the configuration directory:\n\n```shell\nsftpgo revertprovider\n```\n\nTake a look at the CLI usage to learn how to specify a configuration file:\n\n```shell\nsftpgo revertprovider --help\n```\n\nThe `revertprovider` command is not supported for the memory provider.\n\nPlease note that we only support the current release branch and the current main branch, if you find a bug it is better to report it rather than downgrading to an older unsupported version.\n\n## Users, groups, folders and other resource management\n\nAfter starting SFTPGo you can manage users, groups, folders and other resources using:\n\n- the [WebAdmin UI](./docs/web-admin.md)\n- the [REST API](./docs/rest-api.md)\n\nTo support embedded data providers like `bolt` and `SQLite`, which do not support concurrent connections, we can't have a CLI that directly write users and other resources to the data provider, we always have to use the REST API.\n\nFull details for users, groups, folders, admins and other resources are documented in the [OpenAPI](./openapi/openapi.yaml) schema. If you want to render the schema without importing it manually, you can explore it on [Stoplight](https://sftpgo.stoplight.io/docs/sftpgo/openapi.yaml).\n\n:warning: SFTPGo users, groups and folders are virtual and therefore unrelated to the system ones. There is no need to create system-wide users and groups.\n\n## Tutorials\n\nSome step-to-step tutorials can be found inside the source tree [howto](./docs/howto \"How-to\") directory.\n\n## Authentication options\n\n<details><summary> External Authentication</summary>\n\nCustom authentication methods can easily be added. SFTPGo supports external authentication modules, and writing a new backend can be as simple as a few lines of shell script. More information can be found [here](./docs/external-auth.md).\n\n</details>\n\n<details><summary> Keyboard Interactive Authentication</summary>\n\nKeyboard interactive authentication is, in general, a series of questions asked by the server with responses provided by the client.\nThis authentication method is typically used for multi-factor authentication.\n\nMore information can be found [here](./docs/keyboard-interactive.md).\n\n</details>\n\n## Dynamic user creation or modification\n\nA user can be created or modified by an external program just before the login. More information about this can be found [here](./docs/dynamic-user-mod.md).\n\n## Custom Actions\n\nSFTPGo allows you to configure custom commands and/or HTTP hooks to receive notifications about file uploads, deletions and several other events.\n\nMore information about custom actions can be found [here](./docs/custom-actions.md).\n\n## Virtual folders\n\nDirectories outside the user home directory or based on a different storage provider can be mapped as virtual folders, more information [here](./docs/virtual-folders.md).\n\n## Other hooks\n\nYou can get notified as soon as a new connection is established using the [Post-connect hook](./docs/post-connect-hook.md) and after each login using the [Post-login hook](./docs/post-login-hook.md).\nYou can use your own hook to [check passwords](./docs/check-password-hook.md).\n\n## Storage backends\n\n### S3/GCP/Azure\n\nEach user can be mapped with a [S3 Compatible Object Storage](./docs/s3.md) /[Google Cloud Storage](./docs/google-cloud-storage.md)/[Azure Blob Storage](./docs/azure-blob-storage.md) bucket or a bucket virtual folder.\n\n### SFTP backend\n\nEach user can be mapped to another SFTP server account or a subfolder of it. More information can be found [here](./docs/sftpfs.md).\n\n### Encrypted backend\n\nData at-rest encryption is supported via the [cryptfs backend](./docs/dare.md).\n\n### HTTP/S backend\n\nHTTP/S backend allows you to write your own custom storage backend by implementing a REST API. More information can be found [here](./docs/httpfs.md).\n\n### Other Storage backends\n\nAdding new storage backends is quite easy:\n\n- implement the [Fs interface](./internal/vfs/vfs.go#L86 \"interface for filesystem backends\").\n- update the user method `GetFilesystem` to return the new backend\n- update the web interface and the REST API CLI\n- add the flags for the new storage backed to the `portable` mode\n\nAnyway, some backends require a pay per-use account (or they offer free account for a limited time period only). To be able to add support for such backends or to review pull requests, please provide a test account. The test account must be available for enough time to be able to maintain the backend and do basic tests before each new release.\n\n## Brute force protection\n\nSFTPGo supports a built-in [defender](./docs/defender.md).\n\nAlternately you can use the [connection failed logs](./docs/logs.md) for integration in tools such as [Fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/). Example of [jails](./fail2ban/jails) and [filters](./fail2ban/filters) working with `systemd`/`journald` are available in fail2ban directory.\n\n## Account's configuration properties\n\nDetails information about account configuration properties can be found [here](./docs/account.md).\n\n## Performance\n\nSFTPGo can easily saturate a Gigabit connection on low end hardware with no special configuration, this is generally enough for most use cases.\n\nMore in-depth analysis of performance can be found [here](./docs/performance.md).\n\n## Release Cadence\n\nSFTPGo releases are feature-driven, we don't have a fixed time based schedule. As a rough estimate, you can expect 1 or 2 new releases per year.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nSFTPGo makes use of the third party libraries listed inside [go.mod](./go.mod).\n\nWe are very grateful to all the people who contributed with ideas and/or pull requests.\n\nThank you [ysura](https://www.ysura.com/) for granting me stable access to a test AWS S3 account.\n\n## License\n\nGNU AGPL-3.0-only"
