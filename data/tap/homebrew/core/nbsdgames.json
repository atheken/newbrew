  "readme": "# New BSD Games\n *You have a computing machine from 1980's  and you wonder how you can use it? <br/>\n  You are a bored sysadmin with no work, and need to kill time looking busy with terminal?  <br/>\n  You have Plan9 dual-booted with OpenBSD and have kept the OpenBSD just for gaming? <br/>\n  You have to make a Reversi AI for your homework and you don't know where to copy it from? <br/>\n  Your port of Linux to a fancy platform has no GUI, but you still want nice screenshots?<br/>\n  You have been so excited about the bsdgames, but have grown tired of playing tetris, snake and robots for billions of times? <br/>\n  Are you feeling that betrayed you by bundling stuff like phantasia in a package you expected to contain GAMES?<br/>\n  Did you come here thinking it is bsdgames?*<br/>\n\n**Don't worry** anymore as you've got nbsdgames now!\n\nThe games include:\n \n* Jewels (A game with a gameplay kinda similiar to that of Tetris, NOT my invention)\n* Sudoku\n* Mines (Minesweeper)\n* Reversi\n* Checkers\n* Battleship\n* SOS\n* Rabbithole (A maze-exploring game where you have to gather items from all around the maze rather than reaching an end, the idea maybe mine)\n* Pipes (Same as the famous Pipe Mania)\n* Fifteen\n* Memoblocks (or Memory blocks. A similar game was included in Windows 7)\n* Fisher\n* Muncher\n* Miketron\n* Redsquare (Conway's Game of Life made playable!)\n* Darrt (with original gameplay!)\n* Snakeduel\n* Tugow (Numpad practice game)\n\nThe difficulty and/or dimensions are adjustable through simple command line options, you can play a minesweeper game that take hours to complete, or exprience hexadecimal sudoku and 8x8 fifteen-like puzzles!\n\n*Or just enter \"nbsdgames\" at your terminal to get a fancy menu and play all sorts of games from there.*\n\n \nPlay on xterm for best experience.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* git (optional)\n* POSIX make (optional)\n* A C compiler with C99 enabled \n* The standard library\n* ncurses (libncurses5-dev if you are on debian-based distros)\n\nTo install them all on debian-base :\n\n``` sh\n        sudo apt install git make gcc libncurses5-dev\n```\n## How to run\n\n1) Download the files\n2) Go to the sources directory\n3) Install\n\nLike this:\n\n``` sh\n        git clone https://github.com/abakh/nbsdgames\n        cd ./nbsdgames\n        make\n        sudo make install # or use the binaries already compiled\n```\n\n## Packages\n\nIt's on almost every repo by now: Debian (and other DEBs), OpenSUSE (and other RPMs), AUR, Alpine, FreeBSD, NetBSD, DragonflyBSD, Minix, Homebrew (MacOSX) and more \nhttps://repology.org/project/nbsdgames/versions\n\nThanks to Elias Riedel Gårding, Zinjanthropus, Gürkan Myczko, Robert Clausecker, Sam James, and so many other nice people for packaging.\n\nThey also gave back code and useful feedback.\n\n## Other Platforms\n\nThey are known to work on Windows as well (using PDCurses, thanks to Laura Michaels for providing advice).\n\nThey have been ported to Plan9 thanks to Jens Staal!\n\nThanks to PDCurses they even work on DOS and every platform with SDL.\n\nThey should theoretically work on OS/2 as well but I have not verified that yet.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* git (optional)\n* POSIX make (optional)\n* A C compiler with C99 enabled \n* The standard library\n* ncurses (libncurses5-dev if you are on debian-based distros)\n\nTo install them all on debian-base :\n\n``` sh\n        sudo apt install git make gcc libncurses5-dev\n```\n## How to build\n\n1) Download the files\n2) Go to the sources directory\n3) Install\n\nLike this:\n\n``` sh\n        git clone https://github.com/abakh/nbsdgames\n        cd ./nbsdgames\n        make\n        sudo make install # or use the binaries already compiled\n```\n\n\n## How do these look like\nLinux+xterm+tmux\n![Screenshot from 4 games in tmux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abakh/junk/master/screenshot.png)\n\nPlan9\n![Screenshot from the games in Plan9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abakh/junk/master/screenshot_plan9.png)\n\nWindows\n![Screenshot from the games in Windows 7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abakh/junk/master/screenshot_windows.jpg)\n\n## How to contribute\n* Share these with your friends and others\n* Your stars make the repo more findable in Github :star:\n* Tell me your feature requests, bug reports, etc.\n* Tell me the games you want to be added (but in the same genre, I can't port Angry Birds to curses! :)\n* Make a package for your distro (or put it on repos if the package is not there)\n* Tell distro developers to consider adding these as default games, nbsdgames packs a lot of fun games in a few hundreds of kilobytes.\n* Compile these with ASAN, play and find C-ish bugs.\n\nAlso thanks to all the people who helped in the previous versions, all what I requested was done! I didn't expect such an amount of assistance on this project :heart:"
