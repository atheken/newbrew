As you may know, \"to ford\" refers to\ncrossing a river (or other body of water). It does not, in this context, refer\nto any company or individual associated with cars.\n\nFord was written due to [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/)'s\npoor handling of Fortran and the lack of comparable alternatives.\n[ROBODoc](https://rfsber.home.xs4all.nl/Robo/index.html) can't actually extract\nany information from the source code and just about any other automatic\ndocumentation software I found was either proprietary, didn't work very well\nfor Fortran, or was limited in terms of how it produced its output.\n[f90doc](http://erikdemaine.org/software/f90doc/) is quite good and I managed\nto modify it so that it could handle most of Fortran 2003, but it produces\nrather ugly documentation, can't provide as many links between different parts\nof the documentation as I'd like, and is written in Perl (which I'm not that\nfamiliar with and which lacks the sort of libraries found in Python for\nproducing HTML content).\n\nThe goal of FORD is to be able to reliably produce documentation for modern\nFortran software which is informative and nice to look at. The documentation\nshould be easy to write and non-obtrusive within the code. While it will never\nbe as feature-rich as Doxygen, hopefully FORD will be able to provide a good\nalternative for documenting Fortran projects.\n\n## Capabilities\nCurrent features include:\n\n- the ability to extract information about variables, procedures, procedure\n  arguments, derived types, programs, and modules from the source code.\n- the ability to extract documentation from comments in the source code.\n- LaTeX support in documentation using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).\n- searchable documentation, using [Tipue Search](http://www.tipue.com/search/).\n- author description and social media (including Github!) links.\n- links to download the source code.\n- links to individual files, both in their raw form or in HTML with syntax\n  highlighting.\n- use of Markdown to type-set documentation.\n- links between related parts of the software.\n- Bootstrap CSS for the documentation, making it both functional and pretty.\n- configurable settings.\n- ability to create a hierarchical set of pages containing general information,\n  not associated with any particular part of the source code.\n- display an entry for non-Fortran source files with file-level documentation\n  and syntax highlighted code.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe simplest way to install FORD is using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/):\n\n    pip install ford\n\nPip will automatically handle all dependencies for you. By default this will\nplace `ford` in `~/.local/bin` -- you might need to add this to your `PATH`.\n\nAlternatively, FORD is available through the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package\nmanager for Mac OS X. To update Homebrew and install FORD, run these commands in\na terminal:\n\n    brew update\n    brew install FORD\n\nIf you would like to install the latest development (master) branch from github,\nsimply add the `--HEAD` flag: `brew install --HEAD FORD`\n\nFORD is also available through the\n[spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package manager by running the\nfollowing command:\n\n    spack install py-ford\n\n## Documentation\nMore complete documentation can be found in the [docs](https://forddocs.readthedocs.io).\n\n## License\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut **without any warrenty**; without even the implied warranty of\n**merchantability** or **fitness for a particular purpose**.
