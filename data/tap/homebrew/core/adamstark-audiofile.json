A couple of notes on integer types:\n\n* The range of samples is designed to be symmetric. This means that for (e.g.) an signed 8-bit integer (`int8_t`) we will use the range `[-127, 127]` for storing samples representing the `[-1., 1.]` range. The value `-128` is possible here given the `int8_t` type, but this is interpreted as a value slightly lower than `-1` (specifically `-1.007874015748`).\n\n* In the case of unsigned types, we obviously can't store samples as negative values. Therefore, we used the equivalent range of the unsigned type in use. E.g. if with a 8-bit signed integer (`int8_t`) the range would be `[-127, 127]`, for an 8-bit unsigned integer we would use the range `[1, 255]`. Note that we don't use `-128` for `int8_t` or `0` in `uint8_t`.\n\n* If you try to read an audio file with a larger bit-depth than the type you are using to store samples, the attempt to read the file will fail. Put more simply, you can't read a 16-bit audio file into an 8-bit integer.\n\n* If you are writing audio samples in integer formats, you should use the correct sample range for both a) the type you are using to store samples; and b) the bit depth of the audio you want to write.\n\nThe following table details the sample range for each bit-depth:\n\n| Type  | 8-bit Audio | 16-bit Audio | 24-bit Audio | 32-bit Audio |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| `float` | `[-1.0, 1.0]` | `[-1.0, 1.0]` | `[-1.0, 1.0]` | `[-1.0, 1.0]` |\n| `double` | `[-1.0, 1.0]` | `[-1.0, 1.0]` | `[-1.0, 1.0]` | `[-1.0, 1.0]` |\n| `int8_t` | `[-127, 127]` | :x: (type too small) | :x: (type too small) | :x: (type too small) |\n| `uint8_t` | `[1, 255]` | :x: (type too small) | :x: (type too small) | :x: (type too small) |\n| `int16_t` | `[-127, 127]` | `[-32767, 32767]` | :x: (type too small) | :x: (type too small) |\n| `uint16_t` | `[1, 255]` | `[1, 65535]` | :x: (type too small) | :x: (type too small) |\n| `int32_t` | `[-127, 127]` | `[-32767, 32767]` | [`-8388607, 8388607]`  | `[-2147483647, 2147483647]` |\n| `uint32_t` | `[1, 255]` | `[1, 65535]` | `[1, 16777215]` | `[1, 4294967295]` |\n| `int64_t` | `[-127, 127]` | `[-32767, 32767]` | [`-8388607, 8388607]`  | `[-2147483647, 2147483647]` |\n| `uint64_t` | `[1, 255]` | `[1, 65535]` | `[1, 16777215]` | `[1, 4294967295]` |\n\nError Messages\n-----------------\n\nBy default, the library logs error messages to the console to provide information on what has gone wrong (e.g. a file we tried to load didn't exist). \n\nIf you prefer not to see these messages, you can disable this error logging behaviour using:\n\n\taudioFile.shouldLogErrorsToConsole (false);\n\n\nVersions\n-------\n\n##### 1.1.1 - 4th April 2023\n\n- Support for integer formats\n- Improved unit testing\n- Many bug fixes\n\n##### 1.1.0 - 15th January 2022\n\n- Moved project to MIT licence\n- Added option to load an audio file already in memory\n- CI Workflow improvements and bug fixes\n\n##### 1.0.9 - 23rd January 2021\n\n- Faster loading of audio files\n- Bug fixes\n\n##### 1.0.8 - 18th October 2020\n\n- CMake support\n- Construct instances with a file path\n- Bug fixes\n\n##### 1.0.7 - 3rd July 2020\n\n- Support for 32-bit audio files\n- Support for multi-channel audio files\n- Reading/writing of [iXML data chunks](http://www.ixml.info/)\n\n##### 1.0.6 - 29th February 2020\n\n- Made error logging to the console optional\n- Fixed lots of compiler warnings \n\n##### 1.0.5 - 14th October 2019\n\n- Added include of <algorithm> to better support Visual Studio\n\n##### 1.0.4 - 13th October 2019\n\n- Changed to a header-only library.
