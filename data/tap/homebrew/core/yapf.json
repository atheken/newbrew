In essence, the algorithm takes the code and\ncalculates the best formatting that conforms to the configured style. It takes\naway a lot of the drudgery of maintaining your code.\n\nThe ultimate goal is that the code YAPF produces is as good as the code that a\nprogrammer would write if they were following the style guide.\n\n> **Note**\n> YAPF is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is\n> just code that happens to be owned by Google.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install YAPF from PyPI:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install yapf\n```\n\nYAPF is still considered in \"beta\" stage, and the released version may change\noften; therefore, the best way to keep up-to-date with the latest development\nis to clone this repository.\n\nNote that if you intend to use YAPF as a command-line tool rather than as a\nlibrary, installation is not necessary. YAPF supports being run as a directory\nby the Python interpreter. If you cloned/unzipped YAPF into `DIR`, it's\npossible to run:\n\n```bash\n$ PYTHONPATH=DIR python DIR/yapf [options] ...\n```\n\n\n## Required Python versions\n\nYAPF supports Python 3.7+.\n\n> **Note**\n> YAPF requires the code it formats to be valid Python for the version YAPF\n> itself runs under.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```console\nusage: yapf [-h] [-v] [-d | -i | -q] [-r | -l START-END] [-e PATTERN]\n            [--style STYLE] [--style-help] [--no-local-style] [-p] [-m] [-vv]\n            [files ...]\n\nFormatter for Python code.\n\npositional arguments:\n  files                 reads from stdin when no files are specified.\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit\n  -d, --diff            print the diff for the fixed source\n  -i, --in-place        make changes to files in place\n  -q, --quiet           output nothing and set return value\n  -r, --recursive       run recursively over directories\n  -l START-END, --lines START-END\n                        range of lines to reformat, one-based\n  -e PATTERN, --exclude PATTERN\n                        patterns for files to exclude from formatting\n  --style STYLE         specify formatting style: either a style name (for\n                        example \"pep8\" or \"google\"), or the name of a file\n                        with style settings. The default is pep8 unless a\n                        .style.yapf or setup.cfg or pyproject.toml file\n                        located in the same directory as the source or one of\n                        its parent directories (for stdin, the current\n                        directory is used).\n  --style-help          show style settings and exit; this output can be saved\n                        to .style.yapf to make your settings permanent\n  --no-local-style      don't search for local style definition\n  -p, --parallel        run YAPF in parallel when formatting multiple files.\n  -m, --print-modified  print out file names of modified files\n  -vv, --verbose        print out file names while processing\n```\n\n### Return Codes\n\nNormally YAPF returns zero on successful program termination and non-zero\notherwise.\n\nIf `--diff` is supplied, YAPF returns zero when no changes were necessary,\nnon-zero otherwise (including program error). You can use this in a CI workflow\nto test that code has been YAPF-formatted.\n\n### Excluding files from formatting (.yapfignore or pyproject.toml)\n\nIn addition to exclude patterns provided on commandline, YAPF looks for\nadditional patterns specified in a file named `.yapfignore` or `pyproject.toml`\nlocated in the working directory from which YAPF is invoked.\n\n`.yapfignore`'s syntax is similar to UNIX's filename pattern matching:\n\n```\n*       matches everything\n?       matches any single character\n[seq]   matches any character in seq\n[!seq]  matches any character not in seq\n```\n\nNote that no entry should begin with `./`.\n\nIf you use `pyproject.toml`, exclude patterns are specified by `ignore_patterns` key\nin `[tool.yapfignore]` section. For example:\n\n```ini\n[tool.yapfignore]\nignore_patterns = [\n  \"temp/**/*.py\",\n  \"temp2/*.py\"\n]\n```\n\n\nFormatting style\n================\n\nThe formatting style used by YAPF is configurable and there are many \"knobs\"\nthat can be used to tune how YAPF does formatting. See the `style.py` module\nfor the full list.\n\nTo control the style, run YAPF with the `--style` argument. It accepts one of\nthe predefined styles (e.g., `pep8` or `google`), a path to a configuration\nfile that specifies the desired style, or a dictionary of key/value pairs.\n\nThe config file is a simple listing of (case-insensitive) `key = value` pairs\nwith a `[style]` heading. For example:\n\n```ini\n[style]\nbased_on_style = pep8\nspaces_before_comment = 4\nsplit_before_logical_operator = true\n```\n\nThe `based_on_style` setting determines which of the predefined styles this\ncustom style is based on (think of it like subclassing). Four\nstyles are predefined:\n\n- `pep8` (default)\n- `google` (based off of the [Google Python Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md))\n- `yapf` (for use with Google open source projects)\n- `facebook`\n\nSee `_STYLE_NAME_TO_FACTORY` in [`style.py`](https://github.com/google/yapf/blob/main/yapf/yapflib/style.py) for details.\n\nIt's also possible to do the same on the command line with a dictionary. For\nexample:\n\n```bash\n--style='{based_on_style: pep8, indent_width: 2}'\n```\n\nThis will take the `pep8` base style and modify it to have two space\nindentations.\n\nYAPF will search for the formatting style in the following manner:\n\n1. Specified on the command line\n2. In the `[style]` section of a `.style.yapf` file in either the current\n   directory or one of its parent directories.\n3. In the `[yapf]` section of a `setup.cfg` file in either the current\n   directory or one of its parent directories.\n4. In the `[tool.yapf]` section of a `pyproject.toml` file in either the current\n   directory or one of its parent directories.\n5. In the `[style]` section of a `~/.config/yapf/style` file in your home\n   directory.\n\nIf none of those files are found, the default style PEP8 is used.\n\n\nExample\n=======\n\nAn example of the type of formatting that YAPF can do, it will take this ugly\ncode:\n\n```python\nx = {  'a':37,'b':42,\n\n'c':927}\n\ny = 'hello ''world'\nz = 'hello '+'world'\na = 'hello {}'.format('world')\nclass foo  (     object  ):\n  def f    (self   ):\n    return       37*-+2\n  def g(self, x,y=42):\n      return y\ndef f  (   a ) :\n  return      37+-+a[42-x :  y**3]\n```\n\nand reformat it into:\n\n```python\nx = {'a': 37, 'b': 42, 'c': 927}\n\ny = 'hello ' 'world'\nz = 'hello ' + 'world'\na = 'hello {}'.format('world')\n\n\nclass foo(object):\n    def f(self):\n        return 37 * -+2\n\n    def g(self, x, y=42):\n        return y\n\n\ndef f(a):\n    return 37 + -+a[42 - x:y**3]\n```\n\n\n## Example as a module\n\nThe two main APIs for calling YAPF are `FormatCode` and `FormatFile`, these\nshare several arguments which are described below:\n\n```python\n>>> from yapf.yapflib.yapf_api import FormatCode  # reformat a string of code\n\n>>> formatted_code, changed = FormatCode(\"f ( a = 1, b = 2 )\")\n>>> formatted_code\n'f(a=1, b=2)\\n'\n>>> changed\nTrue\n```\n\nA `style_config` argument: Either a style name or a path to a file that\ncontains formatting style settings. If None is specified, use the default style\nas set in `style.DEFAULT_STYLE_FACTORY`.\n\n```python\n>>> FormatCode(\"def g():\\n  return True\", style_config='pep8')[0]\n'def g():\\n    return True\\n'\n```\n\nA `lines` argument: A list of tuples of lines (ints), [start, end], that we\nwant to format. The lines are 1-based indexed. It can be used by third-party\ncode (e.g., IDEs) when reformatting a snippet of code rather than a whole file.\n\n```python\n>>> FormatCode(\"def g( ):\\n    a=1\\n    b = 2\\n    return a==b\", lines=[(1, 1), (2, 3)])[0]\n'def g():\\n    a = 1\\n    b = 2\\n    return a==b\\n'\n```\n\nA `print_diff` (bool): Instead of returning the reformatted source, return a\ndiff that turns the formatted source into reformatted source.\n\n```diff\n>>> print(FormatCode(\"a==b\", filename=\"foo.py\", print_diff=True)[0])\n--- foo.py (original)\n+++ foo.py (reformatted)\n@@ -1 +1 @@\n-a==b\n+a == b\n```\n\nNote: the `filename` argument for `FormatCode` is what is inserted into the\ndiff, the default is `<unknown>`.\n\n`FormatFile` returns reformatted code from the passed file along with its encoding:\n\n```python\n>>> from yapf.yapflib.yapf_api import FormatFile  # reformat a file\n\n>>> print(open(\"foo.py\").read())  # contents of file\na==b\n\n>>> reformatted_code, encoding, changed = FormatFile(\"foo.py\")\n>>> formatted_code\n'a == b\\n'\n>>> encoding\n'utf-8'\n>>> changed\nTrue\n```\n\nThe `in_place` argument saves the reformatted code back to the file:\n\n```python\n>>> FormatFile(\"foo.py\", in_place=True)[:2]\n(None, 'utf-8')\n\n>>> print(open(\"foo.py\").read())  # contents of file (now fixed)\na == b\n```\n\n\n## Formatting diffs\n\nOptions:\n\n```console\nusage: yapf-diff [-h] [-i] [-p NUM] [--regex PATTERN] [--iregex PATTERN][-v]\n                 [--style STYLE] [--binary BINARY]\n\nThis script reads input from a unified diff and reformats all the changed\nlines. This is useful to reformat all the lines touched by a specific patch.\nExample usage for git/svn users:\n\n  git diff -U0 --no-color --relative HEAD^ | yapf-diff -i\n  svn diff --diff-cmd=diff -x-U0 | yapf-diff -p0 -i\n\nIt should be noted that the filename contained in the diff is used\nunmodified to determine the source file to update. Users calling this script\ndirectly should be careful to ensure that the path in the diff is correct\nrelative to the current working directory.\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -i, --in-place        apply edits to files instead of displaying a diff\n  -p NUM, --prefix NUM  strip the smallest prefix containing P slashes\n  --regex PATTERN       custom pattern selecting file paths to reformat\n                        (case sensitive, overrides -iregex)\n  --iregex PATTERN      custom pattern selecting file paths to reformat\n                        (case insensitive, overridden by -regex)\n  -v, --verbose         be more verbose, ineffective without -i\n  --style STYLE         specify formatting style: either a style name (for\n                        example \"pep8\" or \"google\"), or the name of a file\n                        with style settings. The default is pep8 unless a\n                        .style.yapf or setup.cfg or pyproject.toml file\n                        located in the same directory as the source or one of\n                        its parent directories (for stdin, the current\n                        directory is used).\n  --binary BINARY       location of binary to use for YAPF\n```\n\n\n## Knobs\n\n#### `ALIGN_CLOSING_BRACKET_WITH_VISUAL_INDENT`\n\n>    Align closing bracket with visual indentation.\n\n#### `ALLOW_MULTILINE_LAMBDAS`\n\n>    Allow lambdas to be formatted on more than one line.\n\n#### `ALLOW_MULTILINE_DICTIONARY_KEYS`\n\n>    Allow dictionary keys to exist on multiple lines. For example:\n\n```python\n    x = {\n        ('this is the first element of a tuple',\n         'this is the second element of a tuple'):\n             value,\n    }\n```\n\n#### `ALLOW_SPLIT_BEFORE_DEFAULT_OR_NAMED_ASSIGNS`\n\n>    Allow splitting before a default / named assignment in an argument list.\n\n#### `ALLOW_SPLIT_BEFORE_DICT_VALUE`\n\n>    Allow splits before the dictionary value.\n\n#### `ARITHMETIC_PRECEDENCE_INDICATION`\n\n>    Let spacing indicate operator precedence. For example:\n\n```python\n    a = 1 * 2 + 3 / 4\n    b = 1 / 2 - 3 * 4\n    c = (1 + 2) * (3 - 4)\n    d = (1 - 2) / (3 + 4)\n    e = 1 * 2 - 3\n    f = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4\n```\n\n>    will be formatted as follows to indicate precedence:\n\n```python\n    a = 1*2 + 3/4\n    b = 1/2 - 3*4\n    c = (1+2) * (3-4)\n    d = (1-2) / (3+4)\n    e = 1*2 - 3\n    f = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4\n```\n\n#### `BLANK_LINES_AROUND_TOP_LEVEL_DEFINITION`\n\n>    Sets the number of desired blank lines surrounding top-level function and\n>    class definitions. For example:\n\n```python\n    class Foo:\n        pass\n                       # <------ having two blank lines here\n                       # <------ is the default setting\n    class Bar:\n        pass\n```\n\n#### `BLANK_LINE_BEFORE_CLASS_DOCSTRING`\n\n>    Insert a blank line before a class-level docstring.\n\n#### `BLANK_LINE_BEFORE_MODULE_DOCSTRING`\n\n>    Insert a blank line before a module docstring.\n\n#### `BLANK_LINE_BEFORE_NESTED_CLASS_OR_DEF`\n\n>    Insert a blank line before a `def` or `class` immediately nested within\n>    another `def` or `class`. For example:\n\n```python\n    class Foo:\n                       # <------ this blank line\n        def method():\n            pass\n```\n\n#### `BLANK_LINES_BETWEEN_TOP_LEVEL_IMPORTS_AND_VARIABLES`\n\n>    Sets the number of desired blank lines between top-level imports and\n>    variable definitions. Useful for compatibility with tools like isort.\n\n#### `COALESCE_BRACKETS`\n\n>    Do not split consecutive brackets. Only relevant when\n>    `DEDENT_CLOSING_BRACKETS` or `INDENT_CLOSING_BRACKETS` is set. For example:\n\n```python\n    call_func_that_takes_a_dict(\n        {\n            'key1': 'value1',\n            'key2': 'value2',\n        }\n    )\n```\n\n>    would reformat to:\n\n```python\n    call_func_that_takes_a_dict({\n        'key1': 'value1',\n        'key2': 'value2',\n    })\n```\n\n#### `COLUMN_LIMIT`\n\n>    The column limit (or max line-length)\n\n#### `CONTINUATION_ALIGN_STYLE`\n\n>    The style for continuation alignment. Possible values are:\n\n>    - `SPACE`: Use spaces for continuation alignment. This is default\n>      behavior.\n>    - `FIXED`: Use fixed number (`CONTINUATION_INDENT_WIDTH`) of columns\n>      (i.e. `CONTINUATION_INDENT_WIDTH`/`INDENT_WIDTH` tabs or\n>      `CONTINUATION_INDENT_WIDTH` spaces) for continuation alignment.\n>    - `VALIGN-RIGHT`: Vertically align continuation lines to multiple of\n>      `INDENT_WIDTH` columns. Slightly right (one tab or a few spaces) if cannot\n>      vertically align continuation lines with indent characters.\n\n#### `CONTINUATION_INDENT_WIDTH`\n\n>    Indent width used for line continuations.\n\n#### `DEDENT_CLOSING_BRACKETS`\n\n>    Put closing brackets on a separate line, dedented, if the bracketed\n>    expression can't fit in a single line.

But for some code, it won't\nbe as good as hand-formatting. In particular, large data literals may become\nhorribly disfigured under YAPF.\n\nThe reasons for this are manyfold. In short, YAPF is simply a tool to help\nwith development. It will format things to coincide with the style guide, but\nthat may not equate with readability.\n\nWhat can be done to alleviate this situation is to indicate regions YAPF should\nignore when reformatting something:\n\n```python\n# yapf: disable\nFOO = {\n    # ... some very large, complex data literal.\n}\n\nBAR = [\n    # ... another large data literal.\n]\n# yapf: enable\n```\n\nYou can also disable formatting for a single literal like this:\n\n```python\nBAZ = {\n    (1, 2, 3, 4),\n    (5, 6, 7, 8),\n    (9, 10, 11, 12),\n}  # yapf: disable\n```\n\nTo preserve the nice dedented closing brackets, use the\n`dedent_closing_brackets` in your style. Note that in this case all\nbrackets, including function definitions and calls, are going to use\nthat style.  This provides consistency across the formatted codebase.\n\n### Why Not Improve Existing Tools?\n\nWe wanted to use clang-format's reformatting algorithm. It's very powerful and\ndesigned to come up with the best formatting possible. Existing tools were\ncreated with different goals in mind, and would require extensive modifications\nto convert to using clang-format's algorithm.\n\n### Can I Use YAPF In My Program?\n\nPlease do! YAPF was designed to be used as a library as well as a command line\ntool. This means that a tool or IDE plugin is free to use YAPF.\n\n### I still get non-PEP8 compliant code! Why?\n\nYAPF tries very hard to be fully PEP 8 compliant. However, it is paramount\nto not risk altering the semantics of your code. Thus, YAPF tries to be as\nsafe as possible and does not change the token stream\n(e.g., by adding parentheses).\nAll these cases however, can be easily fixed manually. For instance,\n\n```python\nfrom my_package import my_function_1, my_function_2, my_function_3, my_function_4, my_function_5\n\nFOO = my_variable_1 + my_variable_2 + my_variable_3 + my_variable_4 + my_variable_5 + my_variable_6 + my_variable_7 + my_variable_8\n```\n\nwon't be split, but you can easily get it right by just adding parentheses:\n\n```python\nfrom my_package import (my_function_1, my_function_2, my_function_3,\n                        my_function_4, my_function_5)\n\nFOO = (my_variable_1 + my_variable_2 + my_variable_3 + my_variable_4 +\n       my_variable_5 + my_variable_6 + my_variable_7 + my_variable_8)\n```\n\n\n## Gory Details\n\n### Algorithm Design\n\nThe main data structure in YAPF is the `LogicalLine` object. It holds a list\nof `FormatToken`\\s, that we would want to place on a single line if there\nwere no column limit. An exception being a comment in the middle of an\nexpression statement will force the line to be formatted on more than one line.\nThe formatter works on one `LogicalLine` object at a time.\n\nAn `LogicalLine` typically won't affect the formatting of lines before or\nafter it. There is a part of the algorithm that may join two or more\n`LogicalLine`\\s into one line. For instance, an if-then statement with a\nshort body can be placed on a single line:\n\n```python\nif a == 42: continue\n```\n\nYAPF's formatting algorithm creates a weighted tree that acts as the solution\nspace for the algorithm. Each node in the tree represents the result of a\nformatting decision --- i.e., whether to split or not to split before a token.\nEach formatting decision has a cost associated with it. Therefore, the cost is\nrealized on the edge between two nodes. (In reality, the weighted tree doesn't\nhave separate edge objects, so the cost resides on the nodes themselves.)\n\nFor example, take the following Python code snippet. For the sake of this\nexample, assume that line (1) violates the column limit restriction and needs to\nbe reformatted.\n\n```python\ndef xxxxxxxxxxx(aaaaaaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbbb, cccccccc, dddddddd, eeeeee):  # 1\n    pass                                                               # 2\n```\n\nFor line (1), the algorithm will build a tree where each node (a\n`FormattingDecisionState` object) is the state of the line at that token given\nthe decision to split before the token or not. Note: the `FormatDecisionState`\nobjects are copied by value so each node in the graph is unique and a change in\none doesn't affect other nodes.\n\nHeuristics are used to determine the costs of splitting or not splitting.\nBecause a node holds the state of the tree up to a token's insertion, it can\neasily determine if a splitting decision will violate one of the style\nrequirements. For instance, the heuristic is able to apply an extra penalty to\nthe edge when not splitting between the previous token and the one being added.\n\nThere are some instances where we will never want to split the line, because\ndoing so will always be detrimental (i.e., it will require a backslash-newline,\nwhich is very rarely desirable). For line (1), we will never want to split the\nfirst three tokens: `def`, `xxxxxxxxxxx`, and `(`. Nor will we want to\nsplit between the `)` and the `:` at the end. These regions are said to be\n\"unbreakable.\" This is reflected in the tree by there not being a \"split\"\ndecision (left hand branch) within the unbreakable region.\n\nNow that we have the tree, we determine what the \"best\" formatting is by finding\nthe path through the tree with the lowest cost.\n\nAnd that's it!"
