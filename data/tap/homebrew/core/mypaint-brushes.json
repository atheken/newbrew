  "readme": "mypaint-brushes - MyPaint brushes\n=================================\n\nBrushes used by MyPaint and other software using libmypaint.\n\nThis data package is versionned. This are the brushes to be used by\nlibmypaint 2.x, current development version which as of writing, has no releases.\n\nIf you want brushes compatible with libmypaint < 1.5, do not install\nmypaint-brushes from master, but from \"v1.3.x\" branch (or last release\ntagged with a \"v1.x\" version).\n\nlibmypaint >= 1.5 supports the larger number of input points that are\nused in some mappings in the 2.x brushes, which would cause older versions\nof libmypaint to crash if loading the brush data unchecked. It also added\nan alternative API with full support for the new features in 2.x brushes. \n\nBuilding\n---------\n\nmypaint-brushes package can be installed as a typical autotools build:\n\n> ./autogen.sh\n\n> ./configure && make && make install\n\n\nThere are also historical scons scripts, but they work only with scons\n2.x (and in particular not newer scons 3, based on Python 3):\n\n> scons prefix=/your/application/install/prefix # Normal build\n\n> scons -h                                      # Show build options\n\nUsing the brushes with pkg-config\n---------------------------------\n\nIf your application needs libmypaint 2.x brushes, you can make the\nmodule \"mypaint-brushes-2.0\" a dependency with pkg-config.\n\nFor a C/C++ program, the CFlags generated by pkg-config will define the\nmacro MYPAINT_BRUSHES_DIR, usable in your code in order to get the path\nfor all mypaint default brushes.\n\nFor programs in other languages, you can use the variable `brushesdir`\nto get the same information with pkg-config and insert this value in\nyour program in the relevant way.\n\n> pkg-config --variable=brushesdir mypaint-brushes-2.0\n\nLicensing policy\n----------------\n\nOnly public domain (or [Creative Commons 1.0\nUniversal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) is an\nacceptable license for the official `mypaint-brushes` package.\n\nOptionally you may use CC BY (or CC BY-SA) 4.0 for the visible parts\n(such as preview image) but keep the raw brush settings public domain.\n\nBy contributing new brushes, you therefore agree for them to be\nrelicensed Public Domain/CC0 1.0. If you want to propose someone else's\nbrushes, whose copyright you do not own, and if the brushes were not\nalready explicitly license CC0 1.0, you must first contact the original\nauthors.\n\nThe rest of this package (installation scripts, etc.) is license GPL-2+\n(similarly to the MyPaint package). See `Licenses.dep5` for more\naccurate licensing and authorship information."
