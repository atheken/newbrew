  "readme": "# TO BUILD\n\nRun:\n\n    autoreconf && ./configure && make \n\nThen a:\n\n    make install\n\nas root, to get `rdup` installed.\n\nOptionally you can also do a:\n\n    make check\n\nto run the test suite, note that you will need DejaGNU installed \nfor this to work. If you find errors in this testrun, please\nlook at testlogs/rdup.log and send that to the author.\n\nrdup depends on:\n\n* Gmake for compilation\n* Glib to build. Glib is the low level C library of the\n  GTK project. Configure will check for this.\n* PCRE library \n* LibNettle  - if you want rdup-tr to do path encryption and\n  for sha hashing\n\noptional:\n\n* Libarchive - if you want to have rdup-tr\n\nrdup should compile on all unix platforms out there. It is tested on\nthe following\n\n* Linux\n* Solaris\n* FreeBSD\n* Cygwin\n\n./configure will try to do the right thing, if you don't have\nspecific libraries certain functionality isn't built.\n\n# DIFFERENCE WITH RSYNC\n\nWhile rsync really works well, I wanted to have the ability to gzip\nand/or encrypt the backed up files. rsync can not do that. That is why I\nwrote rdup, which, with the help of rdup-tr and rdup-up will do that.\n\nRdup was created to make custom backups, but due to its flexibility it\ncan be used for much more.\n\n# DOCUMENTATION\n\nrdup is a utility inspired by rsync and the plan9 way of doing backups.\nrdup it self does not backup anything, it only print a list of absolute\nfilenames to standard output. Auxiliary scripts are needed that act on\nthis list and implement the backup strategy.  This way rdup can be kept\nlean and mean. Currently the (stripped) rdup executable measures 26 KB (on\ni386) and I don't expect that to increase much (maybe it will even get\nsmaller).\n\nThe manual page explains rdup's options and usage, see rdup(1). For an\nintroduction into making backups see rdup-backups(1). Helper tools\nthat are included are rdup-tr (see rdup-tr(1)) and rdup-up (see\nrdup-up(1)). All manual pages include examples to get you started.\n\nA small script 'rdup-simple' is also included, this makes starting\nwith rdup even more easy: rdup-simple ~ /backup. Will create a\nbackup of your homedir in /backup.\n\n# COPYRIGHT\n\nAll files in this archive are copyrighted by Miek Gieben, unless stated\notherwise in the file itself.\n\n(c) Miek Gieben, 2005-2011.\n\n# LICENSE\n\nGPL, version 3, see the file LICENSE.\n\n# Coding style\n\nAll code has been indented by `indent -linux`"
