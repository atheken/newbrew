  "readme": "# Image Snap\n\nby: Robert Harder\n\nrob@iHarder.net\n\n## Capture Images from the Command Line\n\nhttp://iharder.net/imagesnap\n\nImageSnap is a Public Domain command-line tool that lets you capture still\nimages from an iSight or other video source.\n\n## Installation\n\nImageSnap is included in various package managers such as Homebrew and MacPorts.\nThe easiest way to install `imagesnap` is probably with one of those commands\nsuch as `brew install imagesnap`. \n\nYou can also simply copy the binary `imagesnap` file to someplace on \nyour path like `/usr/local/bin`, or leave it in a \"current directory,\" and \ncall it with `./imagesnap` instead.  If your download has a version number\nappended to it like `imagesnap-0.2.10` then I recommend you rename it\nto just `imagesnap`.\n\nThe first time you use the tool, you may get a popup window from MacOS \nasking to give `imagesnap` permission to access the camera.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n## Usage\nTo capture an image simply run the program from the command line.\nThere is a delay of a few seconds while the camera warms up, and then...snap!\n\n```\n$ imagesnap\nCapturing image from device \"iSight\"..................snapshot.jpg\n```\n\nTo specify a filename, make that your last argument:\n\n```\n$ imagesnap icu.jpg\nCapturing image from device \"FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in)\"..................icu.jpg\n```\n\nIf you have multiple video devices attached to your computer, use the `-l`\n(\"el\") flag to list them:\n\n```\n$ imagesnap -l\nVideo Devices:\n=> EpocCam\n=> OBS Virtual Camera\n=> Logitech BRIO\n=> FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in)\n=> USB 2.0 Camera\n```\n\nTo select a specific video device use the -d device flag with the full\nor partial name of a device:\n\n```\n$ imagesnap -d BRIO\nCapturing image from device \"Logitech BRIO\"..................snapshot.jpg\n```\n\nYou can capture a series of images in a timelapse using the `-t` option.  \nThe following command would take a picture ever 60 seconds:\n\n```\n$ imagesnap -d BRIO -t 60\nCapturing image from device \"Logitech BRIO\"..................snapshot-00001.jpg\nsnapshot-00002.jpg\nsnapshot-00003.jpg\n```\n\nThere is a default warmup period of three seconds (new to version 0.2.13) when you take a picture.\nThis gives the camera time to get its sensors all set up.  Your camera might have a faster or slower\nresponse time, so you can adjust the warmup period to suit your needs.\n\n```\n$ imagesnap -d BRIO -w 0\nCapturing image from device \"Logitech BRIO\"..................snapshot.jpg\n```\n\n\n## Image Formats\n\nOnly JPEG output is supported. \n\n## Changes\n\n* v0.2.16 - Added ability to specify directory where timelapse images will be saved.\n* v0.2.15 - Added `-n` flag to limit the number of timelapse pictures. Also changed first timelapse image numbering to start at one instead of zero.\n* v0.2.14 - Bump to fix distribution problems only\n* v0.2.13 - Default warmup period is now three seconds.  Set ```-w 0``` if you want no delay.\n* v0.2.12 - Supports native M1.  Other tweaks for package managers.\n* v0.2.11 - Some documentation updates and preparing for better integration with package managers like Homebrew and MacPorts\n* v0.2.10 - Fixed bug when showing Capturing image with xxx...snapshot.jpg\n* v0.2.9 - When doing timelapse, sequence numbers will pick up where the last filename left off.\n* v0.2.8 - Removed timestamp from filename when doing sequence of images with `-t` option\n* v0.2.7 - When specifying a device with the `-d` flag, substrings are matched if an exact match is not found.  Some cleanup in the code for modern Xcode versions.  Verified on Mojave and Big Sur\n* v0.2.6 - Unknown point release four years before v0.2.7 - I don't know what it was. \n* v0.2.5 - Added option to delay the first snapshot for some time. Added a time-lapse feature (thanks, Bas Zoetekouw).\n* v0.2.4 - Found bug that caused crash on Mac OS X 10.5 (but not 10.6).\n* v0.2.4beta - Tracking bug that causes crash on Mac OS X 10.5 (but not 10.6).\n* v0.2.3 - Fixed bug that caused all images to be saved as TIFF. Not sure when this bug was introduced.\n* v0.2.2 - Added ability to output jpeg to standard out. Made executable lowercase imagesnap.\n* v0.2.1 - Changed name from ImageCapture to ImageSnap to avoid confusion with Apple's Image Capture application.\n* v0.2 - Multiple file formats (not just TIFF). Faster response.\n* v0.1 - This is the initial release.\n\n## A Note About Public Domain\n\nI have released this software into the Public Domain. That means you can do\nwhatever you want with it. Really. You don't have to match it up with any other\nopen source license â€” just use it. You can rename the files, do whatever you\nwant. If your lawyers say you have to have a license, contact me, and I'll make\na special release to you under whatever reasonable license you desire: MIT, BSD,\nGPL, whatever."
