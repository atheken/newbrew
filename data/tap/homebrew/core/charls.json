JPEG-LS has low complexity (meaning fast compression) and high compression ratios, similar to the JPEG 2000 lossless ratios. JPEG-LS is more similar to the old Lossless JPEG than to JPEG 2000, but interestingly the two different techniques result in vastly different performance characteristics.\nWikipedia on lossless JPEG and JPEG-LS: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_JPEG>  \nTip: ITU makes their version of the JPEG-LS standard (ITU-T.87) freely available for download. The text is identical with the ISO version.\n\n## About this software\n\nThis project's goal is to provide a full implementation of the ISO/IEC 14495-1:1999, \"Lossless and near-lossless compression of continuous-tone still images: Baseline\" standard. This library is written from scratch in portable C++. The main branch uses C++17. The 2.x branch is maintained in C++14. All mainstream JPEG-LS features are implemented by this library.\nAccording to preliminary test results published on <https://imagecompression.info/gralic,> CharLS is about *twice as fast* as the original HP code, and beats both JPEG-XR and JPEG 2000 by a factor 3.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThe following JPEG-LS options are not supported by the CharLS implementation. Most of these options are rarely used in practice.\n\n* No support to encode JPEG restart markers  \n  Decoding is supported, but no recovery mechanisme is implemented for corrupted JPEG-LS files.\n* No support for sub-sampled scans.\n  Sub-sampling is a lossly encoding mechanism and not used in lossless scenarios.\n* No support for multi component frames with mixed component counts in a single scan.\n  While technical possible all known JPEG-LS codecs put multi-component (color) images in a single scan\n  or in multiple scans, but not use a mix of these in one file.\n* No support to encode\\decode images with the height defined after the first scan (DNL marker).\n* No support for JPEG-LS mapping tables (palette).\n* No support for point transform.\n  Point transform is a lossly encoding mechanism and not used in lossless scenarios.\n\n#### Note about JPEG-LS part 2\n\nAfter releasing the original baseline JPEG-LS standard ISO 14495-1:1999, ISO released an extension to the JPEG-LS standard called ISO/IEC 14495-2:2003: \"Lossless and near-lossless compression of continuous-tone still images: Extensions\". Currently CharLS doesn't support these extensions.\n\n## Supported platforms\n\nThe code is regularly compiled/tested on Windows and 64 bit Linux. Additionally, the code has been successfully tested on Linux Intel/AMD 32/64 bit (slackware, debian, gentoo), Solaris SPARC systems, Intel based Macs and Windows CE (ARM CPU, emulated), where the less common compilers may require minor code edits. It leverages C++ language features (templates, traits) to create optimized code, which generally perform best with recent compilers. If you compile with GCC, 64 bit code performs substantially better.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWith [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on Windows\n\n```powershell\nPS> vcpkg install charls charls:x64-windows\n```\n\nWith [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on Linux or macOS\n\n```bash\n~/$ ./vcpkg install charls\n```\n\nFor other platforms, more install options, how to build from source, and more, take a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/team-charls/charls/wiki).\n\nOnce you have the library, the sample folder provides some code samples to get you started.\n\n## Release Management\n\nThis repository is provided as source code, and specifically does not offer binary releases. Instead, it is encouraged to either “live at head” (build from the latest version of or, if necessary, build against a known, supported branch, known as a Long Term Support (LTS) branch.\nSupport for older compiler versions will be phased out, 5 years from the moment that a newer version of that compiler has become available. The same applies to the minimal required C++ language version.\n\n### Long Term Support (LTS) Branches\n\nBefore any major breaking change in the API and/or ABI a branch will be created from main to freeze that snapshot as LTS branch.\n\n## Related Projects\n\n* [CharLS.Native .NET](https://github.com/team-charls/charls-native-dotnet) - a .NET adapter assembly for CharLS: [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CharLS.Native/)\n* [JPEG-LS WIC codec](https://github.com/team-charls/jpegls-wic-codec) - Windows Imaging Component (WIC) codec for JPEG-LS .jls files\n* [charls-js](https://github.com/chafey/charls-js) - WebAssembly build of CharLS: [Demo](https://chafey.github.io/charls-js/test/browser/index.html)\n* [JPEG-LS plugin for Python Pillow](https://github.com/planetmarshall/pillow-jpls) - JPEG-LS plugin for Python Pillow: [Pip package](https://pypi.org/project/pillow-jpls/)\n\n## Users & Acknowledgements\n\nCharLS is being used by [GDCM DICOM toolkit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gdcm/), thanks for [Mathieu Malaterre](https://sourceforge.net/users/malat) for getting CharLS started on Linux. Kato Kanryu wrote an initial version of the color transforms and the DIB output format code, for an [irfanview](https://www.irfanview.com) plugin using CharLS.\n\n## Legal\n\nThe code in this project is available through a BSD style license, allowing use of the code in commercial closed source applications if you wish. **All** the code in this project is written from scratch, and not based on other JPEG-LS implementations.
