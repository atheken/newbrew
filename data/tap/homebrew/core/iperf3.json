  "readme": "iperf3:  A TCP, UDP, and SCTP network bandwidth measurement tool\n================================================================\n\nSummary\n-------\n\niperf is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable\nbandwidth on IP networks.  It supports tuning of various parameters\nrelated to timing, protocols, and buffers.  For each test it reports\nthe measured throughput / bitrate, loss, and other parameters.\n\nThis version, sometimes referred to as iperf3, is a redesign of an\noriginal version developed at NLANR/DAST.  iperf3 is a new\nimplementation from scratch, with the goal of a smaller, simpler code\nbase, and a library version of the functionality that can be used in\nother programs. iperf3 also has a number of features found in other tools\nsuch as nuttcp and netperf, but were missing from the original iperf.\nThese include, for example, a zero-copy mode and optional JSON output.\nNote that iperf3 is *not* backwards compatible with the original iperf.\n\nPrimary development for iperf3 takes place on Ubuntu Linux, FreeBSD,\nand macOS.  At this time, these are the only officially supported\nplatforms, however there have been some reports of success with\nOpenBSD, NetBSD, Android, Solaris, and other Linux distributions.\n\niperf3 is principally developed by ESnet / Lawrence Berkeley National\nLaboratory.  It is released under a three-clause BSD license.\n\nFor more information see: https://software.es.net/iperf\n\nSource code and issue tracker: https://github.com/esnet/iperf\n\nDiscussion forums: https://github.com/esnet/iperf/discussions\n\nObtaining iperf3\n----------------\n\nDownloads of iperf3 are available at:\n\n    https://downloads.es.net/pub/iperf/\n\nTo check out the most recent code, clone the git repository at:\n\n    https://github.com/esnet/iperf.git\n\nBuilding iperf3\n---------------\n\n### Prerequisites: ###\n\nNone.\n\n### Building ###\n\n    ./configure; make; make install\n\n(Note: If configure fails, try running `./bootstrap.sh` first)\n\nInvoking iperf3\n---------------\n\niperf3 includes a manual page listing all of the command-line options.\nThe manual page is the most up-to-date reference to the various flags and parameters.\n\nFor sample command line usage, see:\n\nhttps://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/iperf/\n\nUsing the default options, iperf is meant to show typical well\ndesigned application performance.  \"Typical well designed application\"\nmeans avoiding artificial enhancements that work only for testing\n(such as splice()'ing the data to /dev/null).  iperf does also have\nflags for \"extreme best case\" optimizations, but they must be\nexplicitly activated.\n\nThese flags include:\n\n    -Z, --zerocopy            use a 'zero copy' sendfile() method of sending data\n    -A, --affinity n/n,m      set CPU affinity\n\nBug and Security Reports\n------------------------\n\nBefore submitting a bug report, please make sure you're running the\nlatest version of the code, and confirm that your issue has not\nalready been fixed.  Then submit to the iperf3 issue tracker on\nGitHub:\n\nhttps://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues\n\nIn your issue submission, please indicate the version of iperf3 and\nwhat platform you're trying to run on (provide the platform\ninformation even if you're not using a supported platform, we\n*might* be able to help anyway).  Exact command-line arguments will\nhelp us recreate your problem.  If you're getting error messages,\nplease include them verbatim if possible, but remember to sanitize any\nsensitive information.\n\nIf you have a question about usage or about the code, please do *not*\nsubmit an issue.  Please use one of the mailing lists for that.\n\nIf you suspect there is a potential security issue, please contact the\ndevelopers at:\n\niperf@es.net\n\nRelation to iperf 2.x\n---------------------\n\nAlthough iperf2 and iperf3 both measure network performance,\nthey are not compatible with each other.\nThe projects (as of mid-2021) are in active, but separate, development.\nThe continuing iperf2 development\nproject can be found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/iperf2/.\n\niperf3 contains a number of options and functions not present in\niperf2.  In addition, some flags are changed from their iperf2\ncounterparts:\n\n    -C, --linux-congestion    set congestion control algorithm (Linux only)\n                              (-Z in iperf2)\n    --bidir                   bidirectional testing mode\n                              (-d in iperf2)\n\nSome iperf2 options are not available in iperf3:\n\n    -r, --tradeoff           Do a bidirectional test individually\n    -T, --ttl                time-to-live, for multicast (default 1)\n    -x, --reportexclude [CDMSV]   exclude C(connection) D(data) M(multicast)\n                                  S(settings) V(server) reports\n    -y, --reportstyle C      report as a Comma-Separated Values\n\nAlso removed is the ability to set the options via environment\nvariables.\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\nA set of known issues is maintained on the iperf3 Web pages:\n\nhttps://software.es.net/iperf/dev.html#known-issues\n\nLinks\n-----\n\nThis section lists links to user-contributed Web pages regarding\niperf3.
