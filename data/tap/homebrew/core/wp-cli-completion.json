  "readme": "WP-CLI\n======\n\n[WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) is the command-line interface for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). You can update plugins, configure multisite installations and much more, without using a web browser.\n\nOngoing maintenance is made possible by:\n\n<a href=\"https://automattic.com/\" style=\"height:100px;width:30%;display:inline-block;position:relative;margin:20px;\"><img src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/files/2017/04/automattic-1.png\" style=\"max-height:100%;max-width:100%;position:absolute;top:0;bottom:0;left:0;right:0;margin:auto;\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"70\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-347\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/\" style=\"height:100px;width:30%;display:inline-block;position:relative;margin:20px;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-335\" style=\"max-height:100%;max-width:100%;position:absolute;top:0;bottom:0;left:0;right:0;margin:auto;\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/files/2017/04/bluehost.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"52\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://pantheon.io/\" style=\"height:100px;width:30%;display:inline-block;position:relative;margin:20px;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-333\" style=\"max-height:100%;max-width:100%;position:absolute;top:0;bottom:0;left:0;right:0;margin:auto;\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/files/2019/06/pantheon.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"100\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/\" style=\"height:100px;width:30%;display:inline-block;position:relative;margin:20px;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-332\" style=\"max-height:100%;max-width:100%;position:absolute;top:0;bottom:0;left:0;right:0;margin:auto;\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/files/2019/06/SG_logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"66\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://wpengine.com/\" style=\"height:100px;width:30%;display:inline-block;position:relative;margin:20px;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-333\" style=\"max-height:100%;max-width:100%;position:absolute;top:0;bottom:0;left:0;right:0;margin:auto;\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/files/2017/04/wpengine.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"60\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.cloudways.com/\" style=\"height:100px;width:30%;display:inline-block;position:relative;margin:20px;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3229\" style=\"max-height:100%;max-width:100%;position:absolute;top:0;bottom:0;left:0;right:0;margin:auto;\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/files/2021/02/Cloudways-Logo-e1612285267691.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"62\" /></a>\n\nThe current stable release is [version 2.8.1](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2023/06/05/wp-cli-v2-8-1-release-notes/). For announcements, follow [@wpcli on Twitter](https://twitter.com/wpcli) or [sign up for email updates](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/subscribe/). [Check out the roadmap](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/roadmap/) for an overview of what's planned for upcoming releases.\n\n[![Testing](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/actions/workflows/testing.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/actions/workflows/testing.yml) [![Average time to resolve an issue](https://isitmaintained.com/badge/resolution/wp-cli/wp-cli.svg)](https://isitmaintained.com/project/wp-cli/wp-cli \"Average time to resolve an issue\") [![Percentage of issues still open](https://isitmaintained.com/badge/open/wp-cli/wp-cli.svg)](https://isitmaintained.com/project/wp-cli/wp-cli \"Percentage of issues still open\")\n\nQuick links: [Using](#using) &#124; [Installing](#installing) &#124; [Support](#support) &#124; [Extending](#extending) &#124; [Contributing](#contributing) &#124; [Credits](#credits)\n\n## Using\n\nWP-CLI provides a command-line interface for many actions you might perform in the WordPress admin. For instance, `wp plugin install --activate` ([doc](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/plugin/install/)) lets you install and activate a WordPress plugin:\n\n```bash\n$ wp plugin install user-switching --activate\nInstalling User Switching (1.0.9)\nDownloading installation package from https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/user-switching.1.0.9.zip...\nUnpacking the package...\nInstalling the plugin...\nPlugin installed successfully.\nActivating 'user-switching'...\nPlugin 'user-switching' activated.\nSuccess: Installed 1 of 1 plugins.\n```\n\nWP-CLI also includes commands for many things you can't do in the WordPress admin. For example, `wp transient delete --all` ([doc](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/transient/delete/)) lets you delete one or all transients:\n\n```bash\n$ wp transient delete --all\nSuccess: 34 transients deleted from the database.\n```\n\nFor a more complete introduction to using WP-CLI, read the [Quick Start guide](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/quick-start/). Or, catch up with [shell friends](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/shell-friends/) to learn about helpful command line utilities.\n\nAlready feel comfortable with the basics? Jump into the [complete list of commands](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/) for detailed information on managing themes and plugins, importing and exporting data, performing database search-replace operations and more.\n\n## Installing\n\nDownloading the Phar file is our recommended installation method for most users. Should you need, see also our documentation on [alternative installation methods](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/) ([Composer](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/#installing-via-composer), [Homebrew](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/#installing-via-homebrew), [Docker](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/installing/#installing-via-docker)).\n\nBefore installing WP-CLI, please make sure your environment meets the minimum requirements:\n\n- UNIX-like environment (OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, Cygwin); limited support in Windows environment\n- PHP 5.6 or later\n- WordPress 3.7 or later. Versions older than the latest WordPress release may have degraded functionality\n\nOnce you've verified requirements, download the [wp-cli.phar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar) file using `wget` or `curl`:\n\n```bash\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar\n```\n\nNext, check the Phar file to verify that it's working:\n\n```bash\nphp wp-cli.phar --info\n```\n\nTo use WP-CLI from the command line by typing `wp`, make the file executable and move it to somewhere in your PATH. For example:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x wp-cli.phar\nsudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp\n```\n\nIf WP-CLI was installed successfully, you should see something like this when you run `wp --info`:\n\n```bash\n$ wp --info\nOS:     Linux 5.10.60.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Wed Aug 25 23:20:18 UTC 2021 x86_64\nShell:  /usr/bin/zsh\nPHP binary:     /usr/bin/php8.1\nPHP version:    8.1.0\nphp.ini used:   /etc/php/8.1/cli/php.ini\nMySQL binary:   /usr/bin/mysql\nMySQL version:  mysql  Ver 8.0.27-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 for Linux on x86_64 ((Ubuntu))\nSQL modes:\nWP-CLI root dir:        /home/wp-cli/\nWP-CLI vendor dir:      /home/wp-cli/vendor\nWP_CLI phar path:\nWP-CLI packages dir:    /home/wp-cli/.wp-cli/packages/\nWP-CLI global config:\nWP-CLI project config:  /home/wp-cli/wp-cli.yml\nWP-CLI version: 2.8.1\n```\n\n### Updating\n\nYou can update WP-CLI with `wp cli update` ([doc](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/cli/update/)), or by repeating the installation steps.\n\nIf WP-CLI is owned by root or another system user, you'll need to run `sudo wp cli update`.\n\nWant to live life on the edge? Run `wp cli update --nightly` to use the latest nightly build of WP-CLI. The nightly build is more or less stable enough for you to use in your development environment, and always includes the latest and greatest WP-CLI features.\n\n### Tab completions\n\nWP-CLI also comes with a tab completion script for Bash and ZSH. Just download [wp-completion.bash](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/v2.6.0/utils/wp-completion.bash) and source it from `~/.bash_profile`:\n\n```bash\nsource /FULL/PATH/TO/wp-completion.bash\n```\n\nDon't forget to run `source ~/.bash_profile` afterwards.\n\nIf using zsh for your shell, you may need to load and start `bashcompinit` before sourcing. Put the following in your `.zshrc`:\n\n```bash\nautoload bashcompinit\nbashcompinit\nsource /FULL/PATH/TO/wp-completion.bash\n```\n\n## Support\n\nWP-CLI's maintainers and contributors have limited availability to address general support questions. The [current version of WP-CLI](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/roadmap/) is the only officially supported version.\n\nWhen looking for support, please first search for your question in these venues:\n\n* [Common issues and their fixes](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/common-issues/)\n* [WP-CLI handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/)\n* [Open or closed issues in the WP-CLI GitHub organization](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+org%3Awp-cli+is%3Aissue)\n* [Threads tagged 'WP-CLI' in the WordPress.org support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/topic-tag/wp-cli/)\n* [Questions tagged 'WP-CLI' in the WordPress StackExchange](https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wp-cli)\n\nIf you didn't find an answer in one of the venues above, you can:\n\n* Join the `#cli` channel in the [WordPress.org Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) to chat with whomever might be available at the time. This option is best for quick questions.\n* [Post a new thread](https://wordpress.org/support/forum/wp-advanced/#new-post) in the WordPress.org support forum and tag it 'WP-CLI' so it's seen by the community.\n\nGitHub issues are meant for tracking enhancements to and bugs of existing commands, not general support. Before submitting a bug report, please [review our best practices](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/bug-reports/) to help ensure your issue is addressed in a timely manner.\n\nPlease do not ask support questions on Twitter. Twitter isn't an acceptable venue for support because: 1) it's hard to hold conversations in under 280 characters, and 2) Twitter isn't a place where someone with your same question can search for an answer in a prior conversation.\n\nRemember, libre != gratis; the open source license grants you the freedom to use and modify, but not commitments of other people's time. Please be respectful, and set your expectations accordingly.\n\n## Extending\n\nA **command** is the atomic unit of WP-CLI functionality. `wp plugin install` ([doc](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/plugin/install/)) is one command. `wp plugin activate` ([doc](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/plugin/activate/)) is another.\n\nWP-CLI supports registering any callable class, function, or closure as a command. It reads usage details from the callback's PHPdoc. `WP_CLI::add_command()` ([doc](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/internal-api/wp-cli-add-command/)) is used for both internal and third-party command registration.\n\n```php\n/**\n * Delete an option from the database.\n *\n * Returns an error if the option didn't exist.\n *\n * ## OPTIONS\n *\n * <key>\n * : Key for the option.\n *\n * ## EXAMPLES\n *\n *     $ wp option delete my_option\n *     Success: Deleted 'my_option' option.\n */\n$delete_option_cmd = function( $args ) {\n\tlist( $key ) = $args;\n\n\tif ( ! delete_option( $key ) ) {\n\t\tWP_CLI::error( \"Could not delete '$key' option. Does it exist?\" );\n\t} else {\n\t\tWP_CLI::success( \"Deleted '$key' option.\" );\n\t}\n};\nWP_CLI::add_command( 'option delete', $delete_option_cmd );\n```\n\nWP-CLI comes with dozens of commands. It's easier than it looks to create a custom WP-CLI command. Read the [commands cookbook](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/commands-cookbook/) to learn more. Browse the [internal API docs](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/internal-api/) to discover a variety of helpful functions you can use in your custom WP-CLI command.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe appreciate you taking the initiative to contribute to WP-CLI. It’s because of you, and the community around you, that WP-CLI is such a great project.\n\n**Contributing isn’t limited to just code.** We encourage you to contribute in the way that best fits your abilities, by writing tutorials, giving a demo at your local meetup, helping other users with their support questions, or revising our documentation.\n\nRead through our [contributing guidelines in the handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/contributing/) for a thorough introduction to how you can get involved. Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of other contributors on the project.
