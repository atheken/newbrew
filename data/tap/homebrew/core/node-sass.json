See [the CLI docs][cli] for details.\n\n[cli]: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass\n\n### From Homebrew (macOS or Linux)\n\nIf you use [the Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/), you\ncan install Dart Sass by running\n\n```sh\nbrew install sass/sass/sass\n```\n\nThat'll give you a `sass` executable on your command line that will run Dart\nSass.\n\n### Standalone\n\nYou can download the standalone Dart Sass archive for your operating\nsystem—containing the Dart VM and the snapshot of the executable—from [the\nGitHub release page][]. Extract it, [add the directory to your path][], restart\nyour terminal, and the `sass` executable is ready to run!\n\n[the GitHub release page]: https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/\n[add the directory to your path]: https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/\n\n### From npm\n\nDart Sass is available, compiled to JavaScript, [as an npm package][npm]. You\ncan install it globally using `npm install -g sass` which will provide access to\nthe `sass` executable. You can also add it to your project using\n`npm install --save-dev sass`. This provides the executable as well as a\nlibrary:\n\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass\n\n```js\nconst sass = require('sass');\n\nconst result = sass.compile(scssFilename);\n\n// OR\n\n// Note that `compileAsync()` is substantially slower than `compile()`.\nconst result = await sass.compileAsync(scssFilename);\n```\n\nSee [the Sass website][js api] for full API documentation.\n\n[js api]: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api\n\n#### Dart Sass in the Browser\n\nThe `sass` npm package can also be run directly in the browser. It's compatible\nwith all major web bundlers as long as you disable renaming (such as\n[`--keep-names`] in esbuild). You can also import it directly from a browser as\nan ECMAScript Module without any bundling (assuming `node_modules` is served as\nwell):\n\n[`--keep-names`]: https://esbuild.github.io/api/#keep-names\n\n```html\n<script type=\"importmap\">\n  {\n    \"imports\": {\n      \"immutable\": \"./node_modules/immutable/dist/immutable.es.js\",\n      \"sass\": \"./node_modules/sass/sass.default.js\"\n    }\n  }\n</script>\n\n<!-- Support browsers like Safari 16.3 without import maps support. -->\n<script async src=\"https://unpkg.com/es-module-shims@^1.7.0\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import * as sass from 'sass';\n\n  console.log(sass.compileString(`\n    .box {\n      width: 10px + 15px;\n    }\n  `));\n</script>\n```\n\nOr from a CDN:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"importmap\">\n  {\n    \"imports\": {\n      \"immutable\": \"https://unpkg.com/immutable@^4.0.0\",\n      \"sass\": \"https://unpkg.com/sass@^1.63.0/sass.default.js\"\n    }\n  }\n</script>\n\n<!-- Support browsers like Safari 16.3 without import maps support. -->\n<script async src=\"https://unpkg.com/es-module-shims@^1.7.0\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import * as sass from 'sass';\n\n  console.log(sass.compileString(`\n    .box {\n      width: 10px + 15px;\n    }\n  `));\n</script>\n```\n\nOr even bundled with all its dependencies:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import * as sass from 'https://jspm.dev/sass';\n\n  console.log(sass.compileString(`\n    .box {\n      width: 10px + 15px;\n    }\n  `));\n</script>\n```\n\nSince the browser doesn't have access to the filesystem, the [`compile()`] and\n`compileAsync()` functions aren't available for it. If you want to load other\nfiles, you'll need to pass a [custom importer] to [`compileString()`] or\n[`compileStringAsync()`]. The [legacy API] is also not supported in the browser.\n\n[`compile()`]: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/functions/compile\n[`compileAsync()`]: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/functions/compileAsync\n[custom importer]: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/StringOptionsWithImporter#importer\n[`compileString()`]: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/functions/compileString\n[`compileStringAsync()`]: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/functions/compileStringAsync\n[legacy API]: #legacy-javascript-api\n\n#### Legacy JavaScript API\n\nDart Sass also supports an older JavaScript API that's fully compatible with\n[Node Sass] (with a few exceptions listed below), with support for both the\n[`render()`] and [`renderSync()`] functions. This API is considered deprecated\nand will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.0, so it should be avoided in new projects.\n\n[Node Sass]: https://github.com/sass/node-sass\n[`render()`]: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/functions/render\n[`renderSync()`]: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/functions/renderSync\n\nSass's support for the legacy JavaScript API has the following limitations:\n\n* Only the `\"expanded\"` and `\"compressed\"` values of [`outputStyle`] are\n  supported.\n\n* Dart Sass doesn't support the [`precision`] option. Dart Sass defaults to a\n  sufficiently high precision for all existing browsers, and making this\n  customizable would make the code substantially less efficient.\n\n* Dart Sass doesn't support the [`sourceComments`] option. Source maps are the\n  recommended way of locating the origin of generated selectors.\n\n[`outputStyle`]: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/LegacySharedOptions#outputStyle\n[`precision`]: https://github.com/sass/node-sass#precision\n[`sourceComments`]: https://github.com/sass/node-sass#sourcecomments\n\n#### Using Sass with Jest\n\nIf you're using [Jest] to run your tests, be aware that it has a [longstanding\nbug] where its default test environment breaks JavaScript's built-in\n[`instanceof` operator]. Dart Sass's JS package uses `instanceof` fairly\nheavily, so in order to avoid breaking Sass you'll need to install\n[`jest-environment-node-single-context`] and add `testEnvironment:\n'jest-environment-node-single-context'` to your Jest config.\n\n[Jest]: https://jestjs.io/\n[longstanding bug]: https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/2549\n[`instanceof` operator]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof\n[`jest-environment-node-single-context`]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-environment-node-single-context\n\n### From Pub\n\nIf you're a Dart user, you can install Dart Sass globally using `pub global\nactivate sass`, which will provide a `sass` executable. You can also add it to\nyour pubspec and use it as a library. We strongly recommend importing it with\nthe prefix `sass`:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:sass/sass.dart' as sass;\n\nvoid main(List<String> args) {\n  print(sass.compile(args.first));\n}\n```\n\nSee [the Dart API docs][api] for details.\n\n[api]: https://www.dartdocs.org/documentation/sass/latest/sass/sass-library.html\n\n#### `sass_api` Package\n\nDart users also have access to more in-depth APIs via the [`sass_api` package].\nThis provides access to the Sass AST and APIs for resolving Sass loads without\nrunning a full compilation. It's separated out into its own package so that it\ncan increase its version number independently of the main `sass` package.\n\n[`sass_api` package]: https://pub.dev/packages/sass_api\n\n### From Source\n\nAssuming you've already checked out this repository:\n\n1. [Install Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/install). If you download an archive\n   manually rather than using an installer, make sure the SDK's `bin` directory\n   is on your `PATH`.\n\n2. [Install Buf]. This is used to build the protocol buffers for the [embedded\n   compiler].\n\n3. In this repository, run `dart pub get`. This will install Dart Sass's\n   dependencies.\n\n4. Run `dart run grinder protobuf`. This will download and build the embedded\n   protocol definition.\n\n5. Run `dart bin/sass.dart path/to/file.scss`.\n\n[Install Buf]: https://docs.buf.build/installation\n[embedded compiler]: #embedded-dart-sass\n\nThat's it!\n\n### In Docker\n\nYou can install and run Dart Sass within Docker using the following Dockerfile\ncommands:\n\n```Dockerfile\n# Dart stage\nFROM dart:stable AS dart\nFROM bufbuild/buf AS buf\n\n# Add your scss files\nCOPY --from=another_stage /app /app\n\n# Include Protocol Buffer binary\nCOPY --from=buf /usr/local/bin/buf /usr/local/bin/\n\nWORKDIR /dart-sass\nRUN git clone https://github.com/sass/dart-sass.git . && \\\n  dart pub get && \\\n  dart run grinder protobuf\n# This is where you run sass.dart on your scss file(s)\nRUN dart ./bin/sass.dart /app/sass/example.scss /app/public/css/example.css\n```\n\n## Why Dart?\n\nDart Sass has replaced Ruby Sass as the canonical implementation of the Sass\nlanguage. We chose Dart because it presented a number of advantages:\n\n* It's fast. The Dart VM is highly optimized, and getting faster all the time\n  (for the latest performance numbers, see [`perf.md`][perf]). It's much faster\n  than Ruby, and close to par with C++.\n\n* It's portable. The Dart VM has no external dependencies and can compile\n  applications into standalone snapshot files, so we can distribute Dart Sass as\n  only three files (the VM, the snapshot, and a wrapper script). Dart can also\n  be compiled to JavaScript, which makes it easy to distribute Sass through npm,\n  which the majority of our users use already.\n\n* It's easy to write. Dart is a higher-level language than C++, which means it\n  doesn't require lots of hassle with memory management and build systems. It's\n  also statically typed, which makes it easier to confidently make large\n  refactors than with Ruby.\n\n* It's friendlier to contributors. Dart is substantially easier to learn than\n  Ruby, and many Sass users in Google in particular are already familiar with\n  it. More contributors translates to faster, more consistent development.\n\n[perf]: https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/master/perf.md\n\n## Compatibility Policy\n\nFor the most part, Dart Sass follows [semantic versioning][]. We consider all of\nthe following to be part of the versioned API:\n\n[semantic versioning]: https://semver.org/\n\n* The Sass language semantics implemented by Dart Sass.\n* The Dart API.\n* The JavaScript API.\n* The command-line interface.\n\nBecause Dart Sass has a single version that's shared across the Dart,\nJavaScript, and standalone distributions, this may mean that we increment the\nmajor version number when there are in fact no breaking changes for one or more\ndistributions. However, we will attempt to limit the number of breaking changes\nwe make and group them in as few releases as possible to minimize churn. We\nstrongly encourage users to use [the changelog][] for a full understanding of\nall the changes in each release.\n\n[the changelog]: https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n\nThere is one exception where breaking changes may be made outside of a major\nversion revision. It is occasionally the case that CSS adds a feature that's\nincompatible with existing Sass syntax in some way. Because Sass is committed to\nfull CSS compatibility, we occasionally need to break compatibility with old\nSass code in order to remain compatible with CSS.\n\nIn these cases, we will first release a version of Sass that emits deprecation\nwarnings for any stylesheets whose behavior will change. Then, at least three\nmonths after the release of a version with these deprecation warnings, we will\nrelease a minor version with the breaking change to the Sass language semantics.\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nIn general, we consider any change to Dart Sass's CSS output that would cause\nthat CSS to stop working in a real browser to be a breaking change. However,\nthere are some cases where such a change would have substantial benefits and\nwould only negatively affect a small minority of rarely-used browsers. We don't\nwant to have to block such a change on a major version release.\n\nAs such, if a change would break compatibility with less than 2% of the global\nmarket share of browser according to [StatCounter GlobalStats][], we may release\na minor version of Dart Sass with that change.\n\n[StatCounter GlobalStats]: https://gs.statcounter.com/\n\n### Node.js Compatibility\n\nWe consider dropping support for a given version of Node.js to be a breaking\nchange *as long as* that version is still supported by Node.js. This means that\nreleases listed as Current, Active LTS, or Maintenance LTS according to [the\nNode.js release page][]. Once a Node.js version is out of LTS, Dart Sass\nconsiders itself free to break support if necessary.\n\n[the Node.js release page]: https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/\n\n## Embedded Dart Sass\n\nDart Sass includes an implementation of the compiler side of the [Embedded Sass\nprotocol]. It's designed to be embedded in a host language, which then exposes\nan API for users to invoke Sass and define custom functions and importers.\n\n[Embedded Sass protocol]: https://github.com/sass/sass/blob/main/spec/embedded-protocol.md\n\n### Usage\n\n* `sass --embedded` starts the embedded compiler and listens on stdin.\n* `sass --embedded --version` prints `versionResponse` with `id = 0` in JSON and\n  exits.\n\nThe `--embedded` command-line flag is not available when you install Dart Sass\nas an [npm package]. No other command-line flags are supported with\n`--embedded`.\n\n[npm package]: #from-npm\n\n## Behavioral Differences from Ruby Sass\n\nThere are a few intentional behavioral differences between Dart Sass and Ruby\nSass. These are generally places where Ruby Sass has an undesired behavior, and\nit's substantially easier to implement the correct behavior than it would be to\nimplement compatible behavior. These should all have tracking bugs against Ruby\nSass to update the reference behavior.\n\n1. `@extend` only accepts simple selectors, as does the second argument of\n   `selector-extend()`. See [issue 1599][].\n\n2. Subject selectors are not supported. See [issue 1126][].\n\n3. Pseudo selector arguments are parsed as `<declaration-value>`s rather than\n   having a more limited custom parsing. See [issue 2120][].\n\n4. The numeric precision is set to 10. See [issue 1122][].\n\n5. The indented syntax parser is more flexible: it doesn't require consistent\n   indentation across the whole document. See [issue 2176][].\n\n6. Colors do not support channel-by-channel arithmetic. See [issue 2144][].\n\n7. Unitless numbers aren't `==` to unit numbers with the same value. In\n   addition, map keys follow the same logic as `==`-equality. See\n   [issue 1496][].\n\n8. `rgba()` and `hsla()` alpha values with percentage units are interpreted as\n   percentages. Other units are forbidden. See [issue 1525][].\n\n9. Too many variable arguments passed to a function is an error. See\n   [issue 1408][].\n\n10. Allow `@extend` to reach outside a media query if there's an identical\n    `@extend` defined outside that query. This isn't tracked explicitly, because\n    it'll be irrelevant when [issue 1050][] is fixed.\n\n11. Some selector pseudos containing placeholder selectors will be compiled\n    where they wouldn't be in Ruby Sass. This better matches the semantics of\n    the selectors in question, and is more efficient. See [issue 2228][].\n\n12. The old-style `:property value` syntax is not supported in the indented\n    syntax. See [issue 2245][].\n\n13. The reference combinator is not supported. See [issue 303][].\n\n14. Universal selector unification is symmetrical. See [issue 2247][].\n\n15. `@extend` doesn't produce an error if it matches but fails to unify. See\n    [issue 2250][].\n\n16. Dart Sass currently only supports UTF-8 documents. We'd like to support\n    more, but Dart currently doesn't support them.
