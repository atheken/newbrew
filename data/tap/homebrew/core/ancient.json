  "readme": "# Ancient - Modern decompressor for old data compression formats\n\nThis is a collection of decompression routines for old formats popular in the Amiga, Atari computers and some other systems from 80's and 90's as well as some that are currently used which were used in a some specific way in these old systems.\n\nEven though most of these algorithms are still available for download, scavenging and using them might prove to be a challenge. Thus the purpose of this project is to:\n* Provide a clean, modern implementation of the algorithms - Typically the implementations were not meant to be used outside of the original systems they were made for. Some other ported implementations are incomplete, bad quality or direct translations from old M68K assembly code.\n* Provide a clean BSD-style licensing - Original implementations or their ports might have strange license or no visible license at all. There are also implementations that have been ripped off from some other source thus their legality is questionable at best.\n* Provide a tested implementation - The code is no good if it does not work properly and the old code have a lot of corner cases. These implementations are tested using a cache of available files (~10k) that used these algorithms. Although it does not offer any guarantee especially when we are talking about undocumented formats, it gives hope that there are less \"stupid errors\" in the code. I have also generated a small batch of test files for different formats for testing. The source files are known public domain sources\n\nFor simple usage both a simple command line application as well as a simple API to use the decompressors are provided.  The compression algorithm is automatically detected in most cases, however there are some corner cases where it is not entirely reliable due to weaknesses in the old format used. Please see the [main.cpp](main.cpp) and [ancient.hpp](api/ancient/ancient.hpp) to get an idea.\n\nThis code should compile cleanly on most C++17 capable compilers, and it is tested on clang and MSVC.\n\nSome formats have incorporated weak password protection on them which can be bypassed. However, this project does not attempt to do any real cryptograpy.\n\nCurrently the project does not support any archival files nor self extracting executables.\n\nDecompression algorithms provided:\n* bzip2\n  * both normal and randomized bitstreams\n* Compact (Unix)\n* Compress (Unix)\n  * Supports both old and new formats\n* CrunchMania by Thomas Schwarz\n  * CrM!: Crunch-Mania standard-mode\n  * Crm!: Crunch-Mania standard-mode, sampled\n  * CrM2: Crunch-Mania LZH-mode\n  * Crm2: Crunch-Mania LZH-mode, sampled\n* Disk Masher System a.k.a.
