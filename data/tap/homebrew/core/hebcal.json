Radwin)\n\n## Description\nHebcal is a program which prints out the days in the Jewish calendar\nfor a given Gregorian year.  Hebcal is fairly flexible in terms of which\nevents in the Jewish calendar it displays.  Each of the following can\nbe individualy turned on or off:\n\n* The Hebrew date\n* Jewish Holidays (including Yom Ha'atzmaut and Yom HaShoah etc.)\n* The weekly Sedrah\n* The day of the week\n* The days of the Omer\n\n## Synopsis\n\n```\nusage: hebcal [options] [[ month [ day ]] year | YYYY-MM-DD ]\n       hebcal help\n       hebcal info\n       hebcal cities\n       hebcal warranty\n       hebcal copying\n```\n\nHebcal prints out Hebrew calendars one solar year at a time.\nBy specifying *month*, *day*, or *year*, output can be limited to a\nparticular month or date in a particular year.\n\nNote that *year* is\nusually a four-digit integer, so `92` is during the Roman period, not the\nlate twentieth century. If the Hebrew dates option (`-H`) is turned on,\nthis number represents the Jewish calendar year.\n\n*month* is a number\nfrom 1..12, or the name of a Jewish calendar month. *day* is a number\nfrom 1..31.\n\nA single day may also be specified as `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO 8601 date\nformat).\n\nFor example, the command `hebcal 10 1992` will print out the holidays\noccurring in October of 1992 C.E., while the command `hebcal Tish 5752`\nwill print dates of interest in the month of Tishrei in Jewish calendar\nyear 5752.\n\nIf no year is specified, hebcal will print to stdout the dates of the Jewish\nholidays in the current secular year.\n\nFor example, `hebcal -ho`\nwill just print out the days of the omer for the current year.\n\n### Options\n#### General options\nOption | Description\n--- | ---\n  --help | Show help text\n  --version | Show version number\n\n#### Input Options\nOption | Description\n--- | ---\n -H, --hebrew-date | Use Hebrew date ranges - only needed when e.g. `hebcal -H 5373`\n -I, --infile INFILE | Get non-yahrtzeit Hebrew user events from specified file.

Default 18 if unspecified (default 40 for Jerusalem, 30 for Haifa, 30 for Zichron Ya'akov).\n   -c, --candlelighting | Print candlelighting times.\n   -C, --city city | Set latitude, longitude, and timezone according to specified city. This option implies the -c option.\n   --geo LATITUDE,LONGITUDE | Set location for solar calculations to decimal values LATITUDE and LONGITUDE. Negative longitudes are WEST of the Prime Meridian.\n   -G, --havdalah-deg DEGREES | Set Havdalah to occur this many degrees below the horizon\n   -l, --latitude XX,YY | Set the latitude for solar calculations to `XX` degrees and `YY` minutes. Negative values are south. **Deprecated**: use `--geo` instead.\n   -L, --longitude XX,YY | Set the longitude for solar calculations to `XX` degrees and `YY` minutes. *Negative values are EAST*. The `-l` and `-L` switches must both be used, or not at all. These switches override the `-C` (localize to city) switch. **Deprecated**: use `--geo` instead.\n   -m, --havdalah-mins MINS | Set havdalah to occur this many minutes after sundown\n   -z, --timezone timezone | Use specified timezone, overriding the `-C` (localize to city) switch. For correct DST rules, use a full timezone name (such as `America/New_York`) instead of a timezone abbreviation (such as `EST`)\n   -Z, --zmanim | Add zemanim (Alot HaShachar; Misheyakir; Kriat Shema, sof zeman; Tefilah, sof zeman; Chatzot hayom; Mincha Gedolah; Mincha Ketanah; Plag HaMincha; Tzait HaKochavim)\n\n## Candle-lighting and fast start/end times\n\nHebcal’s candlelighting times are only approximations. If you ever have any doubts about its times, consult your local halachic authority. If you enter geographic coordinates above the arctic circle or antarctic circle, the times are guaranteed to be wrong.\n\nIn addition to candle-lighting on Erev Shabbat and Chag, the\n`-c` switch also generates Havdalah and fast start/end times.\n\nBy default, candle-lighting times are 18 minutes before sunset\n(see `-b` option above for exceptions).\n\nChanukah candle-lighting times are at civil dusk (solar depression\nof 6 degrees) on weekdays. Chanukah candles are lit just before\nShabbat candles on Friday, and immediately after Havdalah on\nSaturday night.\n\nHavdalah time defaults to 72 minutes after sunset (Rabbeinu Tam).\nAdjust with the `-m` (minutes) option or with `-G`\n(havdalah degrees below horizon).\n\nMinor fasts begin in the morning at *alot haShachar* (solar\ndepression 16.1 degrees) and conclude at *tzeit*\nfor 3 medium sized stars (solar depression 7.083 degrees).\nMajor fasts (*Yom Kippur* and *Tish'a B'Av*) begin just before sunset\n(at regular candle-lighting time) and conclude at Havdalah time.\n\nHebcal contains a small database of cities with their associated geographic information and time-zone information. Run `hebcal cities` to print a list of cities supported by the `-C city` flag.\n\nIf your city is NOT on the list, then in order to customize hebcal to your city, you will need to pass it the latitude, longitude, and timezone (see the manual).\n\nSuppose you live in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.\nYour latitude is 44.0181, and your longitude is -88.6353.\nYou are in timezone `America/Chicago`.\nWe'll round the geographic coordinates to the nearest minute.\n\nIn order to get candlelighting times for the current year, you would type\n  ```\n  hebcal -ch --geo 44.0181,-88.6353 -z America/Chicago\n  ```\n\nThe geographic and time information necessary to calculate sundown times can come to hebcal any of three ways:\n\n1. The default: the system manager sets a default city (\"New York\") when the program is compiled.\n2. Hebcal looks in the environment variable `HEBCAL_CITY` for the name of a city in hebcal’s database, and if it finds one, hebcal will make that the new default city.\n3. 1 and 2 may be overridden by command line arguments, including\nthose specified in the `HEBCAL_OPTS` environment variable. The most\nnatural way to do this is to use the `−C city` command. This will\nlocalize hebcal to city. A list of the cities hebcal knows about can\nbe obtained by typing `hebcal cities` at the command prompt. If the\ncity you want isn’t on that list, you can directly control hebcal’s\ngeographic information with the `--geo` (or `−l` and `−L`) and `−z`\nswitches.\n\nFor a status report on customizations, type `hebcal info` at the command prompt.\n\n## Environment\n\nHebcal uses two environment variables:\n<dl>\n<dt>HEBCAL_CITY\n<dd>Hebcal uses this value as the default city for sunset calculations. A list of available cities is available with from hebcal with the command: <code>hebcal cities</code>\n<dt>HEBCAL_OPTS\n<dd>The value of this variable is automatically processed as if it were typed at the command line before any other actual command-line arguments.\n</dl>\n\n### HEBCAL_OPTS\nEvery time hebcal is run, it checks this variable. If it is non-empty, the arguments in that variable are read as though they were typed at the command line before the ones you actually type.\n\nSo you might set `HEBCAL_OPTS` to be\n   ```\n   --geo 44.0181,-88.6353 -z America/Chicago\n   ```\nand if you type\n    ```\n    hebcal -ch\n    ```\nhebcal will think you typed\n    ```\n    hebcal --geo 44.0181,-88.6353 -z America/Chicago -ch\n    ```\n\nFor information on setting environment variables, consult your local guru.\n\n## Author\nDanny Sadinoff\n\nWith contributions from\n\n* Michael J.

Reingold and Nachum Dershowitz. Their program is extremely clear and provides many instructive examples of fine calendar code in emacs-LISP.\n\nFor version 4, candle-lighting times were rewritting using Derick Rethans's [timelib](https://github.com/derickr/timelib).\n\nVersion 5 was ported from C to Go.\n\nA well written treatment of the Jewish calendar for the layman can be found in _Understanding the Jewish Calendar_ by Rabbi Nathan Bushwick. A more complete bibliography on the topic can be found there, as well as in the _Encyclopedia Judaica_ entry on the calendar.\n\n\n## Diagnostics\n<dl>\n<dt>hebcal help\n<dd>Prints a shorter version of this manpage, with comments on each option.\n<dt>hebcal info\n<dd>Prints the version number and default values of the program.\n<dt>hebcal cities\n<dd>Prints a list of cities which hebcal knows about, suitable as arguments to the −C city option.\n<dt>hebcal copying\n<dd>Prints the GNU license, with information about copying the program. See below.\n<dt>hebcal warranty\n<dd>Tells you how there’s NO WARRANTY for hebcal.\n</dl>\n\n## Disclaimer\nThis is just a program I wrote during summer school and while avoiding my senior project. It should not be invested with any sort of halachic authority.\n\n## Bugs\nHebrew dates are only valid before sundown on that secular date. An option to control this will be added in a later release.\n\nWhen using the legacy `-L` flag, negative longitudes are EAST of Greenwich.\n\nSome combinations of options produce weird results, e.g.\n  `hebcal -dH nisan 5744`\n  `hebcal -dH 5744`\nThis comes into play when you use the *HEBCAL_OPTS* environment variable.\n\nThe sunup/sundown routines aren’t accurate enough. If you enter geographic coordinates above the arctic circle or antarctic circle, the times are guaranteed to be wrong.\n\nHebcal only translates between the Gregorian calendar and the Jewish\ncalendar. It does not take into account a correction of eleven days\nthat was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII known as the Gregorian\nReformation. Wednesday, 2 September 1752 was followed by Thursday, 14\nSeptember 1752.\n\nThis means that the results will be at least partly useless where and\nwhen the Gregorian calendar was not used, e.g. before the 1752 in\nBritain and before circa 1918 in Russia.\nSee [\"Gregorian calendar\" on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#Adoption_by_country)\nfor a splendid chart depicting when the changeover from the Julian to\nthe Gregorian calendars occurred in various places.\n\n## Build & Install\n\nTo build hebcal from the source repository, you'll need the following:\n\n* Go version 1.13 or higher\n* GNU make v3.79 or later\n\nOnce you have those, you can prepare the build environment as follows:\n\n```\nmake clean all\n```\n\n## DISTRIBUTION\n   Copyright (C) 1994-2011  Danny Sadinoff\n\n   Portions Copyright (c) 2011-2022 Michael J.
