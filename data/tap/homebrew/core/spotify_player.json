On Debian based systems, run the below command to install application's dependencies:\n    ```shell\n    sudo apt install libssl-dev libasound2-dev libdbus-1-dev\n    ```\n  - On Fedora based systems, run the below command to install application's dependencies:\n    ```shell\n    sudo yum install openssl-devel alsa-lib-devel dbus-devel\n    ```\n\n### Binaries\n\nApplication's prebuilt binaries can be found in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/releases).\n\n**Note**: to run the application, Linux systems need to install additional dependencies as specified in the [Dependencies section](#linux).\n\n### Homebrew\n\nRun `brew install spotify_player` to install the application.\n\n### Cargo\n\nRun `cargo install spotify_player` to install the application from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/spotify_player).\n\n### AUR\n\nRun `yay -S spotify-player` to install the application as an AUR package.\n\n### Void Linux\n\nRun `xbps-install -S spotify-player` to install the application.\n\n### FreeBSD\n\nRun `pkg install spotify-player` to install the `spotify_player` binary from FreeBSD ports.\n\n### NetBSD\n\nUsing the package manager, run `pkgin install spotify-player` to install from the official repositories.\n\nBuilding from source,\n\n```\ncd /usr/pkgsrc/audio/spotify-player\nmake install\n```\n\n### Docker\n\n**Note**: [streaming](#streaming) feature is disabled when using the docker image.\n\nYou can download the binary image of the latest build from the `master` branch by running\n\n```\ndocker pull aome510/spotify_player:latest\n```\n\nthen run\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -it aome510/spotify_player:latest\n```\n\nto run the application.\n\nYou can also use your local config folder to configure the application or your local cache folder to store the application's cache data when running the docker image:\n\n```\ndocker run --rm \\\n-v $APP_CONFIG_FOLDER:/app/config/ \\\n-v $APP_CACHE_FOLDER:/app/cache/ \\\n-it aome510/spotify_player:latest\n```\n\n## Features\n\n### Spotify Connect\n\nTo enable a full [Spotify connect](https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/) support, user will need to register a Spotify application and specify the application's `client_id` in the general configuration file as described in the [configuration documentation](docs/config.md#general).\n\nMore details about registering a Spotify application can be found in the [official Spotify documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/).\n\nWhen `spotify_player` runs with your own `client_id`, press **D** (default shortcut for `SwitchDevice` command) to get the list of available devices, then press **enter** (default shortcut for `ChooseSelected` command) to connect to the selected device.\n\nAn example of using Spotify connect to interact with the Spotify's official application:\n\n![Spotify Connect Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40011582/140323795-8a7ed2bb-7bda-4db2-9672-6036eac6e771.gif)\n\n### Streaming\n\n`spotify_player` supports streaming, which needs to be built/installed with `streaming` feature (**enabled** by default) **and** with an audio backend (`rodio-backend` by default). The streaming feature allows to `spotify_player` to play music directly from terminal.\n\nThe application uses [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) library to create an integrated Spotify client while running. The integrated client will register a Spotify speaker device under the `spotify-player` name, which is accessible on the [Spotify connect](#spotify-connect) device list.\n\n#### Audio backend\n\n`spotify_player` uses [rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio) as the default [audio backend](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Audio-Backends). List of available audio backends:\n\n- `alsa-backend`\n- `pulseaudio-backend`\n- `rodio-backend`\n- `portaudio-backend`\n- `jackaudio-backend`\n- `rodiojack-backend`\n- `sdl-backend`\n- `gstreamer-backend`\n\nUser can change the audio backend when building/installing the application by specifying the `--features` option. For example, to install `spotify_player` with `pulseaudio-backend`, run\n\n```shell\ncargo install spotify_player --no-default-features --features pulseaudio-backend\n```\n\n**Note**:\n\n- needs to specify `--no-default-features` here because `rodio-backend` is one of the default features.\n- user will need to install additional dependencies depending on the selected audio backend. More details can be found in the [Librespot documentation](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Compiling#general-dependencies).\n\nThe `streaming` feature can be also disabled upon installing by running\n\n```shell\ncargo install spotify_player --no-default-features\n```\n\n### Lyric\n\nTo enable lyric support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `lyric-finder` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `lyric-finder` feature included run:\n\n```shell\ncargo install spotify_player --features lyric-finder\n```\n\nUser can view lyric of the currently playing track by calling the `LyricPage` command to go the lyric page. To do this, `spotify_player` needs to be built with a `lyric-finder` feature.\n\nUnder the hood, `spotify_player` retrieves the song's lyric using [Genius.com](https://genius.com).\n\n### Media Control\n\nTo enable media control support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `media-control` feature (**enabled** by default) and set the `enable_media_control` config option to `true` in the [general configuration file](docs/config.md#media-control).\n\nMedia control support is implemented using [MPRIS DBus](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MPRIS) on Linux and OS window event listener on Windows and MacOS.\n\n### Image\n\nTo enable image rendering support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `image` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `image` feature included, run:\n\n```shell\ncargo install spotify_player --features image\n```\n\n`spotify_player` supports rendering image in a full resolution if the application is run on either [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/) or [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html). Otherwise, the image will be displayed as [block characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements).\n\n`spotify_player` also supports rendering images with `sixel` behind `sixel` feature flag, which also enables `image` feature:\n\n```shell\ncargo install spotify_player --features sixel\n```\n\n**Notes**:\n\n- Not all terminals supported by [libsixel](https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel) are supported by `spotify_player` as it relies on a [third-party library](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer) for image rendering. A possible list of supported terminals can be found in [here](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer/blob/dc81f44a97727e04be0b000712e9233c92116ff8/src/printer/sixel.rs#L83-L95).\n- Images rendered by `sixel` can have a _weird_ scale. It's recommended to tweak the `cover_img_scale` config option to get the best result as the scaling works differently with different terminals and fonts.\n\nExamples of image rendering:\n\n- iTerm2:\n\n![iTerm2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40011582/172966798-0aadc431-b0c3-4433-adf3-7526684fc2a0.png)\n\n- Kitty:\n\n![kitty](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40011582/172967028-8cfb2daa-1642-499a-a5bf-8ed77f2b3fac.png)\n\n- Sixel (`foot` terminal, `cover_img_scale=1.8`):\n\n![sixel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40011582/219880331-58ac1c30-bbb0-4c99-a6cc-e5b7c9c81455.png)\n\n- Others:\n\n![others](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40011582/172967325-d2098037-e19e-440a-a38a-5b076253ecb1.png)\n\n### Notify\n\nTo enable desktop notification support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `notify` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `notify` feature included, run:\n\n```shell\ncargo install spotify_player --features notify\n```\n\n**Note**: the notification support in `MacOS` and `Windows` are quite restricted compared to `Linux`.\n\n### Mouse support\n\nCurrently, the only supported use case for mouse is to seek to a position of the current playback by left-clicking to such position in the playback's progress bar.\n\n### Daemon\n\nTo enable a [daemon](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)>) support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `daemon` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `daemon` feature included, run:\n\n```shell\ncargo install spotify_player --features daemon\n```\n\nYou can run the application as a daemon by specifying the `-d` or `--daemon` option: `spotify_player -d`.\n\n**Notes**:\n\n- `daemon` feature requires the `streaming` feature to be enabled and the application to be built with [an audio backend](#audio-backend)\n- because of the OS's restrictions, `daemon` feature doesn't work with the `media-control` feature on Windows and MacOS, which is **enabled by default**. In other words, if you want to use the `daemon` feature on Windows or MacOS, you must install the application with `media-control` feature **disabled**:\n\n  ```shell\n  cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features --features daemon,rodio-backend\n  ```\n\n### CLI Commands\n\n`spotify_player` offers several CLI commands to interact with **a running `spotify_player` instance**.\n\nUnder the hood, the application handles a CLI command by sending requests to a `spotify_player` instance's client socket running on the `client_port` port, a general application configuration with a default value `8080`.\n\nLists of CLI commands:\n\n- `get`: Get Spotify data (playlist/album/artist data, user's data, etc)\n- `playback`: Interact with the playback (start a playback, play-pause, next, etc)\n- `connect`: Connect to a Spotify device\n- `like`: Like currently playing track\n- `authenticate`: Authenticate the application\n- `playlist`: Playlist editing (new, delete, import, fork, etc)\n\nFor more details, run `spotify_player -h` or `spotify_player {command} -h`, in which `{command}` is a CLI command.\n\n## Commands\n\nTo open a shortcut help popup, press `?` or `C-h` (default shortcuts for `OpenCommandHelp` command).\n\nList of supported commands:\n\n| Command                        | Description                                                             | Default

the [keymaps section](docs/config.md#keymaps) in the configuration documentation.\n\n**Tips**:\n\n- `RefreshPlayback` can be used to manually update the playback status.\n- `RestartIntegratedClient` is useful when user wants to switch to another audio device (headphone, earphone, etc) without restarting the application, as the integrated client will be re-initialized with the new device.\n\n### Actions\n\nA list of actions is available for each type of Spotify item (track, album, artist, or playlist).\nFor example, the list of available actions on a track is `[GoToAlbum, GoToArtist, GoToTrackRadio, GoToArtistRadio, GoToAlbumRadio, AddToPlaylist, DeleteFromCurrentPlaylist, AddToLikedTracks, DeleteFromLikedTracks]`.\n\nTo get the list of actions on an item, call the `ShowActionsOnCurrentTrack` command or `ShowActionsOnSelectedItem` command, then press enter (default binding for `ChooseSelected` command) to initiate the selected action.\n\n### Search Page\n\nWhen first entering the search page, the application focuses on the search input. User can then input text, delete one character backward using `backspace`, or search the text using `enter`.\n\nTo move the focus from the search input to the other windows such as track results, album results, etc, use `FocusNextWindow` or `FocusPreviousWindow`.\n\n## Configurations\n\nBy default, `spotify_player` will look into `$HOME/.config/spotify-player` for application's configuration files. This can be changed by either specifying `-c <FOLDER_PATH>` or `--config-folder <FOLDER_PATH>` option.\n\nIf an application configuration file is not found, one will be created with default values.\n\nPlease refer to [the configuration documentation](docs/config.md) for more details on the configuration options.\n\n## Caches\n\nBy default, `spotify_player` will look into `$HOME/.cache/spotify-player` for application's cache files, which include log files, Spotify's authorization credentials, audio cache files, etc. This can be changed by either specifying `-C <FOLDER_PATH>` or `--cache-folder <FOLDER_PATH>` option.\n\n### Logging\n\nThe application stores logs inside the `$APP_CACHE_FOLDER/spotify-player-*.log` file. For debugging or submitting an issue, user can also refer to the backtrace file in `$APP_CACHE_FOLDER/spotify-player-*.backtrace`, which includes the application's backtrace in case of panics/unexpected errors.\n\n`spotify_player` uses `RUST_LOG` environment variable to define the application's [logging level](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.14/log/enum.Level.html). `RUST_LOG` is default to be `spotify_player=INFO`, which only shows the application's logs.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\n`spotify_player` is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and is built on top of awesome libraries such as [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs), [rspotify](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify), [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot), and [many more](spotify_player/Cargo.toml). It's highly inspired by [spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui) and [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot)."
