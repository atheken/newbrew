  "readme": "\nThis is afio 2.5.2\n\n* WHAT IS AFIO, SHOULD I USE IT?\n\nAfio makes cpio-format archives. It deals somewhat gracefully with\ninput data corruption, supports multi-volume archives during\ninteractive operation, and can make compressed archives that are much\nsafer than compressed tar or cpio archives. Afio is best used as an\n`archive engine' in a backup script.\n\nAfio is one of the oldest open source projects around, it started in\n1985, but it is now in 'maintenance only' mode. If you have never used\nafio as an archive engine, you should probably not start using it now.\nIf you are using it: afio is expected to be compatible UNIX time_t\nextensions that will have to happen before the year 2038.\n\n* WHAT IS NEW IN VERSION 2.5.2?\n\nThe main changes with respect to version 2.5.1 are:\n\n- security improvements for the handling of archives from untrusted\n  sources\n\n- when making multivolume archives, added %V feature to include the\n  volume number in subsequent volume file names\n\n- various bug and portability fixes\n\n* CONTACT INFORMATION\n\nThe GitHub repository\n\n https://github.com/kholtman/afio\n\nis now the official home page of afio, you can check there to find out\nif you have the latest version.\n\nNote: there was some useful context information about afio on\nthe on the old (no longer supported) afio home page\n\n  http://members.chello.nl/k.holtman/afio.html\n\nthat has not yet been copied to this GitHub repository, you can use\n\n  https://web.archive.org/web/20160526001116/http://members.chello.nl/k.holtman/afio.html\n\nto read the context information.\n\nThe current maintainer is Koen Holtman (koen.holtman@ieee.org).\n\n(Alternative e-mail address for the maintainer: k.holtman@chello.nl)\n\nYou can post comments, questions, and proposed patches to for afio on\nthis Githubb page, but you can also mail the maintainer.  When mailing\nthe maintainer, please use the word `afio' somewhere in the subject\nline, this lowers the chance that your mail will get accidentally\ndeleted.\n\nMessage from the current maintainer, written in 2018:\n\nAfio is now in a 'maintenance only' mode, with several years between\nformal releases.  'Maintenance only' means that I will be happy to\nanswer questions, to handle bug and problem reports, and to\nincorporate patches that fix bugs, portabiliy problems, and security\nissues.  However, it is very unlikely that I will work on adding major\nnew features, even if the feature request comes with a patch file\nimplementing the feature.\n\nThe main concern that drives my maintenance policy is to avoid\ncreating new bugs that would cause the backup process to silently\nfail.  Because of this concern, I do a lot of manual reviewing and\ntesting for every patch I receive.  I have concluded that I simply do\nnot have the time (and interest level) anymore to do this for patches\nadding new features.  My interest has declined because since about\n2005, hard drives have become so cheap that making fault tolerant\ncompressed archive files for writing to tapes of floppy disks, as afio\ncan do, has become less and less relevant to the needs of average\nLinux user.  I make my personal system backups using rsync on a\ndetachable hard drive.\n\n\n>> See the first lines of afio.c for licensing/redistribution information <<\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfio makes cpio-format archives.  It deals somewhat gracefully with\ninput data corruption.  Supports multi-volume archives during\ninteractive operation.  Afio can make compressed archives that are\nmuch safer than compressed tar or cpio archives.  Afio is best used as\nan `archive engine' in a backup script.\n\nSince version 2.4.8beta1, afio supports files greater than 2 GB.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee the file INSTALLATION for installation instructions.\n\nSee the file SCRIPTS for more information on backup scripts that use\nafio.\n\nSee the file PORTING for information on compiling afio on non-Linux\nmachines.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis afio version is based on a Linux port of afio 2.3.  Since the\noriginal port, significant functionality has been added and some bugs\nwere removed.  While primarily intended for use under Linux, this code\nshould be portable to other UNIX versions.  As far as I know, there\nhas been no afio development beyond 2.3 outside the Linux community.\nThus, it should be safe to advertise ports of this code to other UNIX\nversions as ports of afio version 2.4.1.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfio has far too many options and features (some of which are not even\nin the manual page).  Anything in afio that doesn't relate to reading\nor writing an archive from/to a simple file or pipe or backing up and\nrestoring from floppies remains untested.\n\nIn particular, nobody has verified if the options -p -d -e -g -h -j -l\n-m -u and -R and the special case archive name `!command' really do\nwhat they claim to do.\n\nTypical `tested' afio uses are\n ... | afio -o -v -s 1440k -F -Z /dev/fd0H1440\n afio -oZvx /tmp/pipe1 </tmp/pipe2\n afio -i -Z -k -v -x -n /tmp/pipe1\n ... | afio -s 512m -c 1024 -Z -T 20k -G 1 -E /backup/compressed -v -o \\\n       -L /backup/LOG -z /dev/tape 2>/dev/tty8 >/var/adm/backup\n\nWARNING1: the code for -F (and -f and -K) is a complete mess.  It will\nprobably work in the normal case, but don't expect it to handle a\nwrite/verify error correctly.  If you get such an error, best thing is\nto restart afio completely.\n\nWARNING2:The remote archive facilites (host:/file archive names) have\nnot been exhaustively tested. These facilities have seen a lot of\nreal-life use though.  However, there may be bugs in the code for\nerror handling and error reporting with remote archives.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------"
