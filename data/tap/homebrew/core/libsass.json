  "readme": "LibSass - Sass compiler written in C++\n======================================\n\nCurrently maintained by Marcel Greter ([@mgreter]) and Michael Mifsud ([@xzyfer])\nOriginally created by Aaron Leung ([@akhleung]) and Hampton Catlin ([@hcatlin])\n\n[![GitHub CI](https://github.com/sass/libsass/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sass/libsass/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml \"GitHub CI\")\n[![Windows CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/sass/libsass?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sass/libsass/branch/master \"Appveyor CI\")\n[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/sass/libsass.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/sass/libsass?branch=master \"Code coverage of spec tests\")\n[![Percentage of issues still open](http://isitmaintained.com/badge/open/sass/libsass.svg)](http://isitmaintained.com/project/sass/libsass \"Percentage of issues still open\")\n[![Average time to resolve an issue](http://isitmaintained.com/badge/resolution/sass/libsass.svg)](http://isitmaintained.com/project/sass/libsass \"Average time to resolve an issue\")\n[![Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/badge/tracker?tracker_id=283068)](https://www.bountysource.com/trackers/283068-libsass?utm_source=283068&utm_medium=shield&utm_campaign=TRACKER_BADGE \"Bountysource\")\n\n**Warning:** [LibSass is deprecated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated).\nWhile it will continue to receive maintenance releases indefinitely, there are no\nplans to add additional features or compatibility with any new CSS or Sass features.\nProjects that still use it should move onto\n[Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass).\n\n[LibSass](https://github.com/sass/libsass \"LibSass GitHub Project\") is just a library!\nIf you want to use LibSass to compile Sass, you need an implementer. Some\nimplementations are only bindings into other programming languages. But most also\nship with a command line interface (CLI) you can use directly. There is also\n[SassC](https://github.com/sass/sassc), which is the official lightweight\nCLI tool built by the same people as LibSass.\n\n### Excerpt of Supported Implementations:\n\n- https://github.com/sass/node-sass (Node.js)\n- https://github.com/sass/perl-libsass (Perl)\n- https://github.com/sass/libsass-python (Python)\n- https://github.com/wellington/go-libsass (Go)\n- https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby (Ruby)\n- https://github.com/sass/libsass-net (C#)\n- https://github.com/medialize/sass.js (JS)\n- https://github.com/bit3/jsass (Java)\n- https://github.com/scottdavis/sass.ex (Elixir)\n- https://github.com/Youimmi/sass_compiler (Elixir)\n\nThis list does not say anything about the quality of either the listed or not listed [implementations](docs/implementations.md)!\nThe authors of the listed projects above are just known to work regularly together with LibSass developers.\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nLibSass is a C++ port of the original Ruby Sass CSS compiler with a [C API](docs/api-doc.md).\nWe coded LibSass with portability and efficiency in mind. You can expect LibSass to be a lot\nfaster than Ruby Sass and on par or faster than the best alternative CSS compilers around.\n\nDeveloping\n----------\n\nAs noted above, the LibSass repository does not contain any binaries or other way to execute\nLibSass. Therefore, you need an implementer to develop LibSass. Easiest is to start with\nthe official [SassC](http://github.com/sass/sassc) CLI wrapper. It is *guaranteed* to compile\nwith the latest code in LibSass master, since it is also used in the CI process. There is no\nlimitation here, as you may use any other LibSass implementer to test your LibSass branch!\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nSince LibSass is a pure library, tests are run through the [Sass-Spec](https://github.com/sass/sass-spec)\nproject using the [SassC](http://github.com/sass/sassc) CLI wrapper. To run the tests against LibSass while\ndeveloping, you can run `./script/spec`. This will clone SassC and Sass-Spec under the project folder and\nthen run the Sass-Spec test suite. You may want to update the clones to ensure you have the latest version.\nNote that the scripts in the `./script` folder are mainly intended for our CI needs.\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\nTo build LibSass you need GCC 4.7+ or Clang/LLVM. If your OS is older, you may need to upgrade\nthem first (or install clang as an alternative). On Windows, you need MinGW with GCC 4.7+ or VS 2013\nUpdate 4+. It is also possible to build LibSass with Clang/LLVM on Windows with various build chains\nand/or command line interpreters.\n\nSee the [build docs for further instructions](docs/build.md)!\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nFor all intents and purposes LibSass is fully compatible with the Sass language spec. Any known\ndifferences can be found as open issues.\n\n\n\n\nAbout Sass\n----------\n\nSass is a CSS pre-processor language to add on exciting, new, awesome features to CSS. Sass was\nthe first language of its kind and by far the most mature and up to date codebase.\n\nSass was originally conceived of by the co-creator of this library, Hampton Catlin ([@hcatlin]).\nMost of the language has been the result of years of work by Natalie Weizenbaum ([@nex3]) and\nChris Eppstein ([@chriseppstein]).\n\nFor more information about Sass itself, please visit https://sass-lang.com\n\nInitial development of LibSass by Aaron Leung and Hampton Catlin was supported by [Moovweb](http://www.moovweb.com).\n\nLicensing\n---------\n\nOur [MIT license](LICENSE) is designed to be as simple and liberal as possible.\n\n[@hcatlin]: https://github.com/hcatlin\n[@akhleung]: https://github.com/akhleung\n[@chriseppstein]: https://github.com/chriseppstein\n[@nex3]: https://github.com/nex3\n[@mgreter]: https://github.com/mgreter\n[@xzyfer]: https://github.com/xzyfer"
