  "readme": "OpenPrinting CUPS v2.5b1\n========================\n\n![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/openprinting/cups?include_prereleases)\n![Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/github/license/openprinting/cups)\n[![Build and Test](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/workflows/Build%20and%20Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/actions/workflows/build.yml)\n[![Coverity Scan](https://img.shields.io/coverity/scan/23806)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/openprinting-cups)\n\n> *Note:* This branch is tracking a future CUPS 2.5.x feature release.  Check\n> out the \"2.4.x\" branch for CUPS 2.4.x.\n\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nOpenPrinting CUPS is the most current version of CUPS, a standards-based, open\nsource printing system for Linux® and other Unix®-like operating systems.  CUPS\nsupports printing to:\n\n- [AirPrint™][1] and [IPP Everywhere™][2] printers,\n- Network and local (USB) printers with Printer Applications, and\n- Network and local (USB) printers with (legacy) PPD-based printer drivers.\n\nCUPS provides the System V (\"lp\") and Berkeley (\"lpr\") command-line interfaces,\na configurable web interface, a C API, and common print filters, drivers, and\nbackends for printing.  The [cups-filters][3] project provides additional\nfilters and drivers.\n\nCUPS is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0 with an exception to allow\nlinking against GNU GPL2-only software.  See the files `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`\nfor more information.\n\n> Note: Apple maintains a separate repository for the CUPS that ships with macOS\n> and iOS at <https://github.com/apple/cups>.\n\n[1]: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311\n[2]: https://www.pwg.org/ipp/everywhere.html\n[3]: https://github.com/openprinting/cups-filters\n\n\nReading the Documentation\n-------------------------\n\nInitial documentation to get you started is provided in the root directory of\nthe CUPS sources:\n\n- `CHANGES.md`: A list of changes in the current major release of CUPS.\n- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the CUPS project.\n- `CREDITS.md`: A list of past contributors to the CUPS project.\n- `DEVELOPING.md`: Guidelines for developing code for the CUPS project.\n- `INSTALL.md`: Instructions for building and installing CUPS.\n- `LICENSE`: The CUPS license agreement (Apache 2.0).\n- `NOTICE`: Copyright notices and exceptions to the CUPS license agreement.\n- `README.md`: This file.\n- `REPORTING_ISSUES.md`: Instructions what information to provide when reporting an issue.\n\nOnce you have installed the software you can access the documentation (and a\nbunch of other stuff) online at <http://localhost:631/> and using the `man`\ncommand, for example `man cups`.\n\nIf you're having trouble getting that far, the documentation is located under\nthe `doc/help` and `man` directories.\n\n*Please read the documentation before asking questions.*\n\n\nSetting Up Printers\n-------------------\n\nCUPS includes a web-based administration tool that allows you to manage\nprinters, classes, and jobs on your server.  Open <http://localhost:631/admin/>\nin your browser to access the printer administration tools.  You will be asked\nfor the administration password (root or any other user in the \"sys\", \"system\",\n\"root\", \"admin\", or \"lpadmin\" group on your system) when performing any\nadministrative function.\n\nThe `lpadmin` command is used to manage printers from the command-line.  For\nexample, the following command creates a print queue called \"myprinter\" for an\nIPP Everywhere printer at address \"11.22.33.44\":\n\n    lpadmin -p myprinter -E -v \"ipp://11.22.33.44/ipp/print\" -m everywhere\n\nThe `-p` option specifies the printer name.  The `-E` option enables the printer\nand accepts new print jobs immediately.  The `-v` option specifies the *device\nURI* for the printer, which tells CUPS how to communicate with the printer.  And\nthe `-m` option specifies the model (driver) to use, in this case the IPP\nEverywhere (\"everywhere\") driver that is used for AirPrint and IPP Everywhere\nprinters as well as shared printers and printers supported through Printer\nApplications.\n\nLegacy printers are supported using PPD (PostScript Printer Description) files\nthat describe printer capabilities and driver programs needed for each printer.\nCUPS includes several sample PPD files for common legacy printers:\n\n   Driver                       | PPD Name\n   -----------------------------|------------------------------\n   Dymo Label Printers          | drv:///sample.drv/dymo.ppd\n   Intellitech Intellibar       | drv:///sample.drv/intelbar.ppd\n   EPSON 9-pin Series           | drv:///sample.drv/epson9.ppd\n   EPSON 24-pin Series          | drv:///sample.drv/epson24.ppd\n   Generic PCL Laser Printer    | drv:///sample.drv/generpcl.ppd\n   Generic PostScript Printer   | drv:///sample.drv/generic.ppd\n   HP DeskJet Series            | drv:///sample.drv/deskjet.ppd\n   HP LaserJet Series           | drv:///sample.drv/laserjet.ppd\n   OKIDATA 9-Pin Series         | drv:///sample.drv/okidata9.ppd\n   OKIDATA 24-Pin Series        | drv:///sample.drv/okidat24.ppd\n   Zebra CPCL Label Printer     | drv:///sample.drv/zebracpl.ppd\n   Zebra EPL1 Label Printer     | drv:///sample.drv/zebraep1.ppd\n   Zebra EPL2 Label Printer     | drv:///sample.drv/zebraep2.ppd\n   Zebra ZPL Label Printer      | drv:///sample.drv/zebra.ppd\n\nThe sample drivers provide basic printing capabilities, but generally do not\nexercise the full potential of the printers or CUPS.  Other drivers provide\ngreater printing capabilities.\n\nYou can run the `lpinfo -m` command to list all of the available drivers:\n\n    lpinfo -m\n\nSimilarly, the `lpinfo -v` command lists the available printers and their device\nURIs:\n\n    lpinfo -v\n\nOnce you know the device URI and driver name, add the printer using the\n`lpadmin` command:\n\n    lpadmin -p PRINTER-NAME -E -v \"DEVICE-URI\" -m DRIVER-NAME\n\n\nPrinting Files\n--------------\n\nCUPS provides both the System V `lp` and Berkeley `lpr` commands for printing:\n\n    lp FILENAME\n    lpr FILENAME\n\nBoth the `lp` and `lpr` commands support printing options:\n\n    lp -o media=A4 -o resolution=600dpi FILENAME\n    lpr -o media=A4 -o resolution=600dpi FILENAME\n\nCUPS recognizes many types of images files as well as PDF, PostScript, and text\nfiles, so you can print those files directly rather than through an application.\n\nIf you have an application that generates output specifically for your printer\nthen you need to use the `-oraw` or `-l` options:\n\n    lp -o raw FILENAME\n    lpr -l FILENAME\n\nThis will prevent the filters from misinterpreting your print file.\n\n\nLegal Stuff\n-----------\n\nCopyright © 2020-2023 by OpenPrinting\n\nCopyright © 2007-2020 by Apple Inc.\n\nCopyright © 1997-2007 by Easy Software Products.\n\nCUPS is provided under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0 with\nexceptions for GPL2/LGPL2 software.
