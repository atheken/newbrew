See: https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.28/openssl/#automatic\n\n### How to use\n1. Don't forget to set an upstream for a branch that you want to trim automatically.\n   `git push -u <remote> <branch>` will set an upstream for you on push.\n1. Run `git trim` if you need to trim branches especially after PR reviews. It'll automatically recognize merged or stray branches, and delete it.\n1. You can also `git trim --dry-run` when you don't trust me.\n\n#### Are you using git-flow?\n\nDon't forget to `git config trim.bases develop,master`.\n\n## Why have you made this? Show me how it works.\n\n### `git fetch --prune` doesn't do all the works for you\n\nThere are so many lines of commands to type and many statuses of branches that corresponding to PRs that you've sent.\nWere they merged or rejected? Did I forget to delete the remote branch after it is merged?\n\nAfter some working with the repository, you'll execute `git fetch --prune` or `git remote update --prune` occasionally.\nHowever, you'll likely see the mess of local branches whose upstreams are already merged and deleted on the remote.\nBecause `git fetch --prune` only deletes remote-tracking branches (or remote references, `refs/remotes/<remote>/<branch>`) but not local tracking branches (`refs/heads/<branch>`) for you.\nIt is worse if remote branches that are merged but the maintainer forgot to delete them,\nthe remote-tracking branches would not be deleted and so on even if you know that it is merged into the master.\n\n![before](images/0-before.png)\n\nThey are tedious to delete manually. `git branch --merged`'ll likely to betray you when branches are rebase merged or squash merged.\n\n![git branch --merged doesn't help](images/1-branch-merged.png)\n\nAfter the PR is merged or rejected, you're likely to delete them manually if you don't have `git-trim` but it is tedious to type and error-prone.\n\n![old way of deleting them](images/2-old-way.png)\n\nYou repeat these same commands as much as PRs that you've sent.\nYou have to remember what local branch is for the PR that just have been closed and it is easy to make a mistake.\nI feel nervous whenever I put `--force` flag. Rebase merge forces to me to use `--force` (no pun is intended).\n`git reflog` is a fun command to play with, isn't it? Also `git remote update` and `git push` is not instantaneous.\nI hate to wait for the prompt even it is a fraction of a second when I have multiple commands to type.\n\n![gvsc before](images/gvsc-0.png)\n\n### Why don't you just use `git fetch --prune` or `git <bash oneliner HERE> | xargs git branch -D`\n\nSee [FAQ](#faq)\n\n### See how `git-trim` works!\n\nIt is enough to type just `git trim` and hit the `y` key once.\n\n![git trim](images/3-git-trim-in-action.png)\n\nVoila!\n\n![after](images/4-after.png)\n\nThat's why I've made `git-trim`.\nIt knows whether a branch is merged into the base branches, or whether it is rejected.\nIt can even `push --delete` when you forgot to delete the remote branch if needed.\n\n![gvsc after](images/gvsc-1.png)\n\n## Configurations\n\nSee `--help` or [docs](docs/git-trim.man)\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What is different to `git fetch --prune`?\n\ngit fetch --prune only deletes remote-tracking branches (or remote references, `refs/remotes/...`) when the remote branches are deleted.\n\nThe problem is that it doesn't touch local tracking branches that track the remote upstream branches\neven if the upstreams are merged into the base and deleted by somehow. You should manually delete corresponding tracking branches in that case.\nIf you use rebase merge, you might have to use scary `--force` flag such as `git branch --delete --force`.\n\n`git-trim` does detect whether the upstream branches are merged into the upstream of the base branch.\nIt knows whether it is safe to delete, and even knows that you forgot to delete the remote branch after the merge.\n\n### What is different to `<bash one-liner HERE> | xargs git branch -D`\n\nJust deleting tracking branches whose upstreams are gone with `-D`, which implies `--force`,\nneeds an extra caution since it might delete contents that are not fully merged into the base or modified after being merged.\nNot because `--force` is dangerous. Just `gone` doesn't mean it is fully merged to the base. So I gave it steroids, and it became `git-trim`.\n\n * It inspects the upstream of tracking branches whether they are 'fully' merged, not just whether they are gone.\n I've spent about half of the code on scenario tests. I wanted to make sure that it doesn't delete unmerged contents accidentally in any case.\n * It supports github flow (master-feature tiered branch strategy), git flow (master-develop-feature tiered branch strategy),\n and simple workflow (with a remote repo and a local clone), and triangular workflow (with two remote repos and a local clone).\n * It is merge styles agnostic. It can detect common merge styles such as merge with a merge commit, rebase/ff merge and squash merge.\n * It can also inspect remote branches so it deletes them from remotes for you in case you've forgotten to.\n * Moreover, it runs in parallel. Otherwise, large repos with hundreds of stale branches would've taken a couple of minutes to inspect whether they are merged.\n\n### What kind of merge styles that `git-trim` support?\n\n* A classic merge with a merge commit with `git merge --no-ff`\n* A rebase merge with `git merge --ff-only` (With `git cherry` equivalents)\n* A squash merge with `git merge --squash` (With this method: https://stackoverflow.com/a/56026209)\n\n### What is the difference between the `merged` and `stray` branch?\n\nA merged branch is a branch whose upstream branch is fully merged onto the upstream of the base branch so you're not going to lose the changes.\n\nIn contrast, a stray branch is a branch that there is a chance to lose some changes if you delete it.\nYour PRs are sometimes rejected and deleted from the remote.\nOr you might have been mistakenly amended or rebased the branch and the patch is now completely different from the patch\nthat is merged because you forgot the fact that the PR is already merged.\nThen they are not safe to delete blindly just because their upstreams are deleted.\nThe term is borrowed from the git's remote tracking states.\n\n### I'm even more lazy to type `git trim`\n\nTry this `post-merge` hook. It automatically calls `git trim --no-update` everytime you `git pull` on `master` or `develop`. `git config fetch.prune true` is recommended with this hook.\n```shell\n#!/bin/bash\nBRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)\ncase \"$HEAD_BRANCH\" in\n    \"master\"|\"develop\") ;;\n    *) exit ;;\nesac\n\ngit trim --no-update\n```\nOr try [`git-sync`](https://gist.github.com/foriequal0/55763d9177803c325904d089299f0970) script. It pulls & prunes & trims in a single command.\n\n### `trim`? `stray`? They are weird choices of terms.\n\nI wanted to use `prune`, `stale`, but they are already taken.\n\n## Disclaimers\nGit and the Git logo are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Software Freedom Conservancy, Inc., corporate home of the Git Project, in the United States and/or other countries.\n\nThe logo is a derivative work of [Git Logo](https://git-scm.com/downloads/logos).
