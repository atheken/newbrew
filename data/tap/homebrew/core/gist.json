  "readme": "gist(1) -- upload code to https://gist.github.com\n=================================================\n\n## Synopsis\n\nThe gist gem provides a `gist` command that you can use from your terminal to\nupload content to https://gist.github.com/.\n\n## Installation\n\n‌If you have ruby installed:\n\n    gem install gist\n\n‌If you're using Bundler:\n\n    source :rubygems\n    gem 'gist'\n\n‌For OS X, gist lives in Homebrew\n\n    brew install gist\n\n‌For FreeBSD, gist lives in ports\n\n    pkg install gist\n\n<200c>For Ubuntu/Debian\n\n    apt install gist\n\nNote: Debian renames the binary to `gist-paste` to avoid a name conflict.\n\n## Command\n\n‌To upload the contents of `a.rb` just:\n\n    gist a.rb\n\n‌Upload multiple files:\n\n    gist a b c\n    gist *.rb\n\n‌By default it reads from STDIN, and you can set a filename with `-f`.\n\n    gist -f test.rb <a.rb\n\n‌Alternatively, you can just paste from the clipboard:\n\n    gist -P\n\n‌Use `-p` to make the gist private:\n\n    gist -p a.rb\n\n‌Use `-d` to add a description:\n\n    gist -d \"Random rbx bug\" a.rb\n\n‌You can update existing gists with `-u`:\n\n    gist -u GIST_ID FILE_NAME\n    gist -u 42f2c239d2eb57299408 test.txt\n\n‌If you'd like to copy the resulting URL to your clipboard, use `-c`.\n\n    gist -c <a.rb\n\n‌If you'd like to copy the resulting embeddable URL to your clipboard, use `-e`.\n\n    gist -e <a.rb\n\n‌And you can just ask gist to open a browser window directly with `-o`.\n\n    gist -o <a.rb\n\n‌To list (public gists or all gists for authed user) gists for user\n\n    gist -l : all gists for authed user\n    gist -l defunkt : list defunkt's public gists\n\nTo read a gist and print it to STDOUT\n\n    gist -r GIST_ID\n    gist -r 374130\n\n‌See `gist --help` for more detail.\n\n## Login\n\nBefore you use `gist` for the first time you will need to log in. There are two supported login flows:\n\n1. The Github device-code Oauth flow. This is the default for authenticating to github.com, and can be enabled for Github Enterprise by creating an Oauth app, and exporting the environment variable `GIST_CLIENT_ID` with the client id of the Oauth app.\n2. The (deprecated) username and password token exchange flow. This is the default for GitHub Enterprise, and can be used to log into github.com by exporting the environment variable `GIST_USE_USERNAME_AND_PASSWORD`.\n\n### The device-code flow\n\nThis flow allows you to obtain a token by logging into GitHub in the browser and typing a verification code. This is the preferred mechanism.\n\n    gist --login\n    Requesting login parameters...\n    Please sign in at https://github.com/login/device\n      and enter code: XXXX-XXXX\n    Success! https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/4f7ec0d4eab38e74384e\n\nThe returned access_token is stored in `~/.gist` and used for all future gisting.  If you need to you can revoke access from  https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/4f7ec0d4eab38e74384e.\n\n### The username-password flow\n\nThis flow asks for your GitHub username and password (and 2FA code), and exchanges them for a token with the \"gist\" permission (your username and password are not stored). This mechanism is deprecated by GitHub, but may still work with GitHub Enterprise.\n\n    gist --login\n    Obtaining OAuth2 access_token from GitHub.\n    GitHub username: ConradIrwin\n    GitHub password:\n    2-factor auth code:\n    Success! https://github.com/settings/tokens\n\nThis token is stored in `~/.gist` and used for all future gisting. If you need to\nyou can revoke it from https://github.com/settings/tokens, or just delete the\nfile. \n\n#### Password-less login\n\nIf you have a complicated authorization requirement you can manually create a\ntoken file by pasting a GitHub token with `gist` scope (and maybe the `user:email`\nfor GitHub Enterprise) into a file called `~/.gist`. You can create one from\nhttps://github.com/settings/tokens\n\nThis file should contain only the token (~40 hex characters), and to make it\neasier to edit, can optionally have a final newline (`\\n` or `\\r\\n`).\n\nFor example, one way to create this file would be to run:\n\n    (umask 0077 && echo MY_SECRET_TOKEN > ~/.gist)\n\nThe `umask` ensures that the file is only accessible from your user account.\n\n### GitHub Enterprise\n\nIf you'd like `gist` to use your locally installed [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com/),\nyou need to export the `GITHUB_URL` environment variable (usually done in your `~/.bashrc`).\n\n    export GITHUB_URL=http://github.internal.example.com/\n\nOnce you've done this and restarted your terminal (or run `source ~/.bashrc`), gist will\nautomatically use GitHub Enterprise instead of the public github.com\n\nYour token for GitHub Enterprise will be stored in `.gist.<protocol>.<server.name>[.<port>]` (e.g.\n`~/.gist.http.github.internal.example.com` for the GITHUB_URL example above) instead of `~/.gist`.\n\nIf you have multiple servers or use Enterprise and public GitHub often, you can work around this by creating scripts\nthat set the env var and then run `gist`. Keep in mind that to use the public GitHub you must unset the env var. Just\nsetting it to the public URL will not work. Use `unset GITHUB_URL`\n\n### Token file format\n\nIf you cannot use passwords, as most Enterprise installations do, you can generate the token via the web interface\nand then simply save the string in the correct file. Avoid line breaks or you might see:\n```\n$ gist -l\nError: Bad credentials\n```\n\n# Library\n\n‌You can also use Gist as a library from inside your ruby code:\n\n    Gist.gist(\"Look.at(:my => 'awesome').code\")\n\nIf you need more advanced features you can also pass:\n\n* `:access_token` to authenticate using OAuth2 (default is `File.read(\"~/.gist\")).\n* `:filename` to change the syntax highlighting (default is `a.rb`).\n* `:public` if you want your gist to have a guessable url.\n* `:description` to add a description to your gist.\n* `:update` to update an existing gist (can be a URL or an id).\n* `:copy` to copy the resulting URL to the clipboard (default is false).\n* `:open` to open the resulting URL in a browser (default is false).\n\nNOTE: The access_token must have the `gist` scope and may also require the `user:email` scope.\n\n‌If you want to upload multiple files in the same gist, you can:\n\n    Gist.multi_gist(\"a.rb\" => \"Foo.bar\", \"a.py\" => \"Foo.bar\")\n\n‌If you'd rather use gist's builtin access_token, then you can force the user\n  to obtain one by calling:\n\n    Gist.login!\n\n‌This will take them through the process of obtaining an OAuth2 token, and storing it\nin `~/.gist`, where it can later be read by `Gist.gist`\n\n## Configuration\n\n‌If you'd like `-o` or `-c` to be the default when you use the gist executable, add an\nalias to your `~/.bashrc` (or equivalent). For example:\n\n    alias gist='gist -c'\n\n‌If you'd prefer gist to open a different browser, then you can export the BROWSER\nenvironment variable:\n\n    export BROWSER=google-chrome\n\nIf clipboard or browser integration don't work on your platform, please file a bug or\n(more ideally) a pull request.\n\nIf you need to use an HTTP proxy to access the internet, export the `HTTP_PROXY` or\n`http_proxy` environment variable and gist will use it.\n\n## Meta-fu\n\nThanks to @defunkt and @indirect for writing and maintaining versions 1 through 3.\nThanks to @rking and @ConradIrwin for maintaining version 4.\n\nLicensed under the MIT license.
