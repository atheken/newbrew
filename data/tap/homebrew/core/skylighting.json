  "readme": "skylighting\n===========\n\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv2+-brightgreen.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)\n[![CI tests](https://github.com/jgm/skylighting/workflows/CI%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jgm/skylighting/actions)\n\nA Haskell syntax highlighting library with tokenizers derived\nfrom KDE XML syntax highlighting descriptions.\n\nA command-line highlighter program, `skylighting`, is also provided.\n\nThis project is divided up into five packages:\n\n * `skylighting-core`: this provides KDE XML parsing, data types,\n   and a tokenizer. This includes the core functionality of the\n   skylighting project licensed under the BSD3 license, along with the\n   KDE XML files, some of which are licensed under the LGPL or GPL. This\n   package does not provide any built-in parsers corresponding to the\n   XML descriptions, however. For that, use `skylighting`.\n* `skylighting-format-ansi`: this provides formatters for\n  rendering skylighting tokens as colored ANSI text.\n* `skylighting-format-blaze-html`: this provides formatters for\n  rendering skylighting tokens as HTML, using the `blaze-html` library.\n* `skylighting-format-context`: this provides formatters for\n   rendering skylighting tokens as ConTeXt.\n* `skylighting-format-latex`: this provides formatters for\n  rendering skylighting tokens as LaTeX.\n* `skylighting`: this exposes the `skylighting-core` API and\n   ANSI, HTML, ConTeXt, and LaTeX formatters, and also\n   provides bundled Haskell parser modules derived from the XML\n   descriptions in the `core` package. This package is entirely licensed\n   under the GPL.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nThis library is the successor to [highlighting-kate], which had\nsome problems that were difficult to resolve given its\narchitecture.\n\nIn highlighting-kate, the XML syntax descriptions were converted\ninto individual parsec parsers, which were then compiled.  This\nmade it difficult to handle IncludeRules properly without\ncircular imports.  There was also no way to load a syntax\ndescription dynamically.\n\nSkylighting, by contrast, parses the XML syntax descriptions\ninto Haskell data structures, which are then interpreted by\na \"tokenize\" function.  IncludeRules can now be handled\nproperly, and users can add new syntax descriptions\ndynamically.  It is also now possible to convert `.theme` files\ndirectly into styles.\n\nSkylighting is also faster than highlighting-kate, by a\nfactor of 3 in some cases.\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nTo install the latest release from Hackage, do\n\n    stack install skylighting\nor\n\n    cabal install skylighting\n\nIf you want the command-line tool, set the `executable` flag\nusing `--flag \"skylighting:executable\"` in stack or\n`-fexecutable` in cabal.\n\nThe release tarball for the `skylighting` package includes generated\nfiles not present in this repository. Building from this repository is\na two-step process. In the first step we build the `skylighting-core`\npackage, which provides a program, `skylighting-extract`, which reads\nXML syntax highlighting definitions from the `xml` directory and writes\nHaskell source files. In the second we actually build the `skylighting`\npackage.\n\nUsing cabal:\n\n    # First, build skylighting-extract\n    cabal build -fexecutable skylighting-core\n    # This will print the path of the built executable.\n    # Replace $EXE with this path in the following steps\n    # Now, generate the syntax files\n    cd ../skylighting\n    $EXE ../skylighting-core/xml\n    cabal install -fexecutable\n\nUsing stack:\n\n    stack build --flag skylighting-core:executable skylighting-core\n    cd skylighting\n    stack exec skylighting-extract -- ../skylighting-core/xml\n    cd ..\n    stack install --flag skylighting:executable\n\n\nCommand-line tool\n-----------------\n\nA command-line executable, `skylighting`, is installed if\nthe `executable` cabal flag is set in building.\n\nFor help, `skylighting --help`.\n\nAdding new syntaxes\n-------------------\n\nTo compile with additional syntaxes, simply add the syntax definition\n(XML) file to the `xml` directory of the `skylighting-core` package and\nrepeat the bootstrap build described above.\n\nNote that both the library and the executable can dynamically load\nsyntax definitions, so you may not need to compile them in. If you\nprefer this approach, you can use the `skylighting-core` package\ndirectly which provides the XML files without the generated code\nproduced by the bootstrap process described above.\n\nIf the syntax definition you are adding is not already in the\n[KDE repository], please submit it upstream so it can be\nincluded there.  You can do that here, providing the file (or\nchanges) and a test:\n<https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/syntax-highlighting/-/merge_requests>.\nHere is a sample merge request:\n<https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/syntax-highlighting/-/merge_requests/20/diffs>.\nIf creating a proper merge request is too much work, at least\nsubmit an issue to\n<https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/syntax-highlighting/-/issues>\nalerting the KDE developers of the availability of a new or\nchanged syntax definition; they can then decide whether to\nintegrate it.\n\nWe normally pull changes in syntax definitions from upstream\nbefore each release.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe `skylighting` package is licensed under the GPL because some of the\nXML syntax descriptions from which its tokenizers are generated are\nGPL-licensed. However, the `skylighting-core` package, which provides\nthe core types and functions of this project is licensed under the BSD3\nlicense and bundles the GPL-licensed XML files separately.\n\nThe KDE project now recommends that new syntax highlighting\nfiles be MIT licensed.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nKate syntax highlighting documentation:\n<https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kate/katepart/highlight.html>\n\nKate highlighting definitions: [KDE repository]\n\n[KDE repository]: <https://github.com/KDE/syntax-highlighting/tree/master/data/syntax>\n\n[highlighting-kate]: https://github.com/jgm/highlighting-kate"
