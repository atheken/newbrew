It's a convenience library API to using libjpeg to load JPEG\nimages destined to be turned into thumbnails of the original, saving\ninformation with these thumbnails, retreiving it and managing to load the image\nready for scaling with the minimum of fuss and CPU overhead.\n\nThis means it's insanely fast at loading large JPEG images and scaling them\ndown to tiny thumbnails. It's speedup will be proportional to the size\ndifference between the source image and the output thumbnail size as a\ncount of their pixels.\n\nIt makes use of libjpeg features of being able to load an image by only\ndecoding the DCT coefficients needed to reconstruct an image of the size\ndesired. This gives a massive speedup. If you do not try and access the pixels\nin a format other than YUV (or GRAY8 if the source is grascale) then it also\navoids colorspace conversions as well.\n\nOriginal Version\n----------------\n\nThe epeg library was developed within the [Enlightenment](http://www.enlightenment.org) project. \nAs of some unknown version the epeg library disappeared from the project or was merged into some other library.\nThe last version of epeg I know of is epeg [v0.9.1.042](https://github.com/mattes/epeg/archive/v0.9.1.042.zip).\n\n**Please note that the latest master branch of this repository contains code updates and improvements.**\n\nBindings\n--------\n * Python, https://github.com/jbaiter/epeg-cffi, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/epeg-cffi\n * Node.js, https://www.npmjs.org/package/epeg\n\nBlog posts\n----------\n\n * [blazing fast epeg photo resize on raspberry pi](https://web.archive.org/web/20160310234752/http://blog.sunekaae.com/2013/04/blazing-fast-epeg-photo-resize-on_3.html) by Sune Kaae\n\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nCopyright (C) 2000 Carsten Haitzler and various contributors (see AUTHORS)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to\ndeal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the\nrights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or\nsell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies of the Software and its Copyright notices.
