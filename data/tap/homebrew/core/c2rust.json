These prerequisites may be installed with the following commands, depending on your platform:\n\n- **Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 10, and later:**\n\n    ```sh\n    apt install build-essential llvm clang libclang-dev cmake libssl-dev pkg-config python3 git\n    ```\n\nDepending on the LLVM distribution, the `llvm-dev` package may also be required.\nFor example, the official LLVM packages from [apt.llvm.org](https://apt.llvm.org/) require `llvm-dev` to be installed.\n\n- **Arch Linux:**\n\n    ```sh\n    pacman -S base-devel llvm clang cmake openssl python\n    ```\n\n- **NixOS / nix:**\n\n    ```sh\n    nix-shell\n    ```\n\n- **macOS:** Xcode command-line tools and recent LLVM (we recommend the Homebrew version) are required.\n\n    ```sh\n    xcode-select --install\n    brew install llvm python3 cmake openssl\n    ```\n\nThe C2Rust transpiler now builds using a stable Rust compiler.\nIf you are developing other features,\nyou may need to install the correct nightly compiler version.\n\n### Installing from crates.io\n\n```sh\ncargo install c2rust\n```\n\nYou can also set the LLVM version explicitly if you have multiple installed,\nlike this, for example:\n\n```sh\nLLVM_CONFIG_PATH=llvm-config-14 cargo install c2rust\n```\n\nOn macOS with Homebrew LLVM, you need to point the build system at the LLVM installation. The path for the installation is architecture dependent:\n\n- **Intel Macs:**\n\n    ```sh\n    LLVM_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-config cargo install c2rust\n    ```\n\n\n- **Apple Silicon Macs:**\n\n    ```sh\n    LLVM_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-config cargo install c2rust\n    ```\n\nOn Linux with Linuxbrew LLVM, you need to point the build system at the LLVM installation as follows:\n\n```sh\nLLVM_CONFIG_PATH=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-config cargo install c2rust\n```\n\nNote: adjust `LLVM_CONFIG_PATH` accordingly if Linuxbrew was installed to your home directory.\n\nOn Gentoo, you need to point the build system to\nthe location of `libclang.so` and `llvm-config` as follows:\n\n```sh\nLLVM_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/llvm-config LIBCLANG_PATH=/path/to/libclang.so cargo install c2rust\n```\n\nIf you have trouble with building and installing, or want to build from the latest master,\nthe [developer docs](docs/README-developers.md#building-with-system-llvm-libraries)\nprovide more details on the build system.\n\n### Installing from Git\n\nIf you'd like to check our recently developed features or you urgently require a bugfixed version of `c2rust`,\nyou can install it directly from Git:\n\n```sh\ncargo install --git https://github.com/immunant/c2rust.git c2rust\n```\n\nPlease note that the master branch is under constant development and you may experience issues or crashes.\n\nYou should also set `LLVM_CONFIG_PATH` accordingly if required as described above.\n\n<!-- ANCHOR_END: installation -->\n<!-- ANCHOR: translating-c-to-rust -->\n\n## Translating C to Rust\n\nTo translate C files specified in `compile_commands.json` (see below),\nrun the `c2rust` tool with the `transpile` subcommand:\n\n```sh\nc2rust transpile compile_commands.json\n```\n\n(The `c2rust refactor` tool was also available for refactoring Rust code, see [refactoring](./c2rust-refactor/), but is now being replaced by a more robust way to refactor.)\n\nThe translator requires the exact compiler commands used to build the C code.\nThis information is provided via a [compilation database](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html) file named `compile_commands.json`.\n(Read more about [compilation databases here](https://sarcasm.github.io/notes/dev/compilation-database.html)).\nMany build systems can automatically generate this file;\nwe show [a few examples below](#generating-compile_commandsjson-files).\n\nOnce you have a `compile_commands.json` file describing the C build,\ntranslate the C code to Rust with the following command:\n\n```sh\nc2rust transpile path/to/compile_commands.json\n```\n\nTo generate a `Cargo.toml` template for a Rust library, add the `-e` option:\n\n```sh\nc2rust transpile --emit-build-files path/to/compile_commands.json\n```\n\nTo generate a `Cargo.toml` template for a Rust binary, do this:\n\n```sh\nc2rust transpile --binary myprog path/to/compile_commands.json\n```\n\nWhere `--binary myprog` tells the transpiler to use\nthe `main` function from `myprog.rs` as the entry point for a binary.\n\nThe translated Rust files will not depend directly on each other like\nnormal Rust modules.\nThey will export and import functions through the C API.\nThese modules can be compiled together into a single static Rust library or binary.\n\nThere are several [known limitations](./docs/known-limitations.md) in this\ntranslator.\nThe translator will emit a warning and attempt to skip function\ndefinitions that cannot be translated.\n\n### Generating `compile_commands.json` Files\n\nThe `compile_commands.json` file can be automatically created\nusing either `cmake`, `meson`, `intercept-build`, or `bear`.\n\nIt may be a good idea to remove optimizations (`-OX`) from the compilation database,\nas there are optimization builtins which we do not support translating.\n\n#### ... with `cmake`\n\nWhen creating the initial build directory with `cmake`,\nspecify `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1`.\nThis only works on projects configured to be built by `cmake`.\nThis works on Linux and MacOS.\n\n```sh\ncmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 ...\n```\n\n#### ... with `meson`\n\nWhen creating the initial build directory with `meson`,\nit will automatically generate a `compile_commands.json`\nfile inside of `<build_dir>`.\n\n```sh\nmeson setup <build_dir>\n```\n\n#### ... with `intercept-build`\n\n`intercept-build` (part of the [scan-build tool](https://github.com/rizsotto/scan-build))\nis recommended for non-`cmake` projects.\n`intercept-build` is bundled with `clang` under `tools/scan-build-py`,\nbut a standalone version can be easily installed via `pip` with:\n\n```sh\npip install scan-build\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```sh\nintercept-build <build command>\n```\n\nYou can also use `intercept-build` to generate a compilation database\nfor compiling a single C file.  For example:\n\n```sh\nintercept-build sh -c \"cc program.c\"\n```\n\n#### ... with `bear` (Linux only)\n\nIf you have [`bear`](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) installed,\nit can be used similarly to `intercept-build`:\n\n```sh\nbear <build command>\n```\n\n#### ... with `compiledb`\n\nThe `compiledb` package can also be used for makefile projects if the other tools don't work.\nInstall via `pip` with:\n\n```sh\npip install compiledb\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```sh\n# After running\n./autogen.sh && ./configure # etc.\n# Run\ncompiledb make\n```\n\n<!-- ANCHOR_END: translating-c-to-rust -->\n\n## Contact\n\nTo report issues with translation or refactoring,\nplease use our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/immunant/c2rust/issues).\n\nTo reach the development team, join our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/ANSrTuu)\nor email us at [c2rust@immunant.com](mailto:c2rust@immunant.com).\n\n## FAQ\n\n> I translated code on platform X, but it didn't work correctly on platform Y.\n\nWe run the C preprocessor before translation to Rust.\nThis specializes the code to the host platform.\nFor this reason, we do not support cross compiling translated code at the moment.\n\n> What platforms can C2Rust be run on?\n\nThe translator and refactoring tool support both macOS and Linux.\nOther features, such as cross checking the functionality\nbetween C and Rust code, are currently limited to Linux hosts.\n\n## Acknowledgements and Licensing\n\nThis material is available under the BSD-3 style license as found in the\n[LICENSE](./LICENSE) file.\n\nThe C2Rust translator is inspired by Jamey Sharp's [Corrode](https://github.com/jameysharp/corrode) translator.\nWe rely on [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten)'s\nRelooper algorithm to translate arbitrary C control flows.\n\nThis material is based upon work supported by the United States Air Force and\nDARPA under Contract No. FA8750-15-C-0124.
