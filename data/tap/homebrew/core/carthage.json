Get Carthage by running `brew install carthage` or choose [another installation method](#installing-carthage)\n1. Create a [Cartfile][] in the same directory where your `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` is\n1. List the desired dependencies in the [Cartfile][], for example:\n\n\t```\n\tgithub \"Alamofire/Alamofire\" ~> 5.5\n\t```\n\n1. Run `carthage update --use-xcframeworks`\n1. A `Cartfile.resolved` file and a `Carthage` directory will appear in the same directory where your `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` is\n1. Drag the built `.xcframework` bundles from `Carthage/Build` into the \"Frameworks and Libraries\" section of your application’s Xcode project.\n1. If you are using Carthage for an application, select \"Embed & Sign\", otherwise \"Do Not Embed\".\n\nFor an in depth guide, read on from [Adding frameworks to an application](#adding-frameworks-to-an-application)\n\n## Installing Carthage\n\nThere are multiple options for installing Carthage:\n\n* **Installer:** Download and run the `Carthage.pkg` file for the latest [release](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases), then follow the on-screen instructions. If you are installing the pkg via CLI, you might need to run `sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local` first.\n\n* **Homebrew:** You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and install the `carthage` tool on your system simply by running `brew update` and `brew install carthage`. (note: if you previously installed the binary version of Carthage, you should delete `/Library/Frameworks/CarthageKit.framework`).\n\n* **MacPorts:** You can use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) and install the `carthage` tool on your system simply by running `sudo port selfupdate` and `sudo port install carthage`. (note: if you previously installed the binary version of Carthage, you should delete `/Library/Frameworks/CarthageKit.framework`).\n\n* **From source:** If you’d like to run the latest development version (which may be highly unstable or incompatible), simply clone the `master` branch of the repository, then run `make install`. Requires Xcode 10.0 (Swift 4.2).\n\n## Adding frameworks to an application\n\nOnce you have Carthage [installed](#installing-carthage), you can begin adding frameworks to your project. Note that Carthage only supports dynamic frameworks, which are **only available on iOS 8 or later** (or any version of OS X).\n\n### Getting started\n\n#### Building platform-independent XCFrameworks (Xcode 12 and above)\n\n1. Create a [Cartfile][] that lists the frameworks you’d like to use in your project.\n1. Run `carthage update --use-xcframeworks`. This will fetch dependencies into a [Carthage/Checkouts][] folder and build each one or download a pre-compiled XCFramework.\n1. On your application targets’ _General_ settings tab, in the _Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content_ section, drag and drop each XCFramework you want to use from the [Carthage/Build][] folder on disk.\n\n##### Migrating a project from framework bundles to XCFrameworks\n\nWe encourage using XCFrameworks as of version 0.37.0 (January 2021), and require XCFrameworks when building on an Apple Silicon Mac. Switching from discrete framework bundles to XCFrameworks requires a few changes to your project:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Migration steps</summary>\n\n1. Delete your `Carthage/Build` folder to remove any existing framework bundles.\n1. Build new XCFrameworks by running `carthage build --use-xcframeworks`. Any other arguments you build with can be provided like normal.\n1. Remove references to the old frameworks in each of your targets:\n    - Delete references to Carthage frameworks from the target's _Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content_ section and/or its _Link Binary with Libraries_ build phase.\n    - Delete references to Carthage frameworks from any _Copy Files_ build phases.\n    - Delete the target's `carthage copy-frameworks` build phase, if present.\n1. Add references to XCFrameworks in each of your targets:\n    - For an application target: In the _General_ settings tab, in the _Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content_ section, drag and drop each XCFramework you use from the [Carthage/Build][] folder on disk.\n    - For a framework target: In the _Build Phases_ tab, in a _Link Binary with Libraries_ phase, drag and drop each XCFramework you use from the [Carthage/Build][] folder on disk.\n\n</details>\n\n#### Building platform-specific framework bundles (default for Xcode 11 and below)\n\n**Xcode 12+ incompatibility**: Multi-architecture platforms are not supported when building framework bundles in Xcode 12 and above. Prefer [building with XCFrameworks](#building-platform-independent-xcframeworks-xcode-12-and-above). If you need to build discrete framework bundles, [use a workaround xcconfig file](Documentation/Xcode12Workaround.md).\n\n##### If you're building for macOS\n\n<details>\n\t<summary>macOS-specific instructions</summary>\n\n1. Create a [Cartfile][] that lists the frameworks you’d like to use in your project.\n1. Run `carthage update --platform macOS`. This will fetch dependencies into a [Carthage/Checkouts][] folder and build each one or download a pre-compiled framework.\n1. On your application targets’ _General_ settings tab, in the _Embedded Binaries_ section, drag and drop each framework you want to use from the [Carthage/Build][] folder on disk.\n\nAdditionally, you'll need to copy debug symbols for debugging and crash reporting on OS X.\n\n1. On your application target’s _Build Phases_ settings tab, click the _+_ icon and choose _New Copy Files Phase_.\n1. Click the _Destination_ drop-down menu and select _Products Directory_.\n1. For each framework you’re using, drag and drop its corresponding dSYM file.\n\n</details>\n\n##### If you're building for iOS, tvOS, or watchOS\n\n<details>\n\t<summary>Platform-specific instructions</summary>\n\n1. Create a [Cartfile][] that lists the frameworks you’d like to use in your project.\n1. Run `carthage update`. This will fetch dependencies into a [Carthage/Checkouts][] folder, then build each one or download a pre-compiled framework.\n1. Open your application targets’ _General_ settings tab. For Xcode 11.0 and higher, in the \"Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content\" section, drag and drop each framework you want to use from the [Carthage/Build][] folder on disk. Then, in the \"Embed\"  section, select \"Do Not Embed\" from the pulldown menu for each item added. For Xcode 10.x and lower, in the \"Linked Frameworks and Libraries\" section, drag and drop each framework you want to use from the [Carthage/Build][] folder on disk.\n1. On your application targets’ _Build Phases_ settings tab, click the _+_ icon and choose _New Run Script Phase_. Create a Run Script in which you specify your shell (ex: `/bin/sh`), add the following contents to the script area below the shell:\n\n    ```sh\n    /usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks\n    ```\n1. Create a file named `input.xcfilelist` and a file named `output.xcfilelist`\n\n1. Add the paths to the frameworks you want to use to your `input.xcfilelist`. For example:\n\n    ```\n    $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Result.framework\n    $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/ReactiveSwift.framework\n    $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/ReactiveCocoa.framework\n    ```\n\n1. Add the paths to the copied frameworks to the `output.xcfilelist`. For example:\n\n    ```\n    $(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH)/Result.framework\n    $(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH)/ReactiveSwift.framework\n    $(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH)/ReactiveCocoa.framework\n    ```\n\n    With output files specified alongside the input files, Xcode only needs to run the script when the input files have changed or the output files are missing. This means dirty builds will be faster when you haven't rebuilt frameworks with Carthage.\n\n1. Add the `input.xcfilelist` to the \"Input File Lists\" section of the Carthage run script phase\n1. Add the `output.xcfilelist` to the \"Output File Lists\" section of the Carthage run script phase\n\nThis script works around an [App Store submission bug](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216) triggered by universal binaries and ensures that necessary bitcode-related files and dSYMs are copied when archiving.\n\nWith the debug information copied into the built products directory, Xcode will be able to symbolicate the stack trace whenever you stop at a breakpoint. This will also enable you to step through third-party code in the debugger.\n\nWhen archiving your application for submission to the App Store or TestFlight, Xcode will also copy these files into the dSYMs subdirectory of your application’s `.xcarchive` bundle.\n</details>\n\n#### For all platforms\n\nAlong the way, Carthage will have created some [build artifacts][Artifacts]. The most important of these is the [Cartfile.resolved][] file, which lists the versions that were actually built for each framework. **Make sure to commit your [Cartfile.resolved][]**, because anyone else using the project will need that file to build the same framework versions.\n\n#### (Optionally) Add build phase to warn about outdated dependencies\n\nYou can add a Run Script phase to automatically warn you when one of your dependencies is out of date.\n\n1. On your application targets’ `Build Phases` settings tab, click the `+` icon and choose `New Run Script Phase`. Create a Run Script in which you specify your shell (ex: `/bin/sh`), add the following contents to the script area below the shell:\n\n```sh\n/usr/local/bin/carthage outdated --xcode-warnings 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n#### Swift binary framework download compatibility\n\nCarthage will check to make sure that downloaded Swift (and mixed Objective-C/Swift) frameworks were built with the same version of Swift that is in use locally. If there is a version mismatch, Carthage will proceed to build the framework from source. If the framework cannot be built from source, Carthage will fail.\n\nBecause Carthage uses the output of `xcrun swift --version` to determine the local Swift version, make sure to run Carthage commands with the Swift toolchain that you intend to use. For many use cases, nothing additional is needed. However, for example, if you are building a Swift 2.3 project using Xcode 8.x, one approach to specifying your default `swift` for `carthage bootstrap` is to use the following command:\n\n```\nTOOLCHAINS=com.apple.dt.toolchain.Swift_2_3 carthage bootstrap\n```\n\n### Running a project that uses Carthage\n\nAfter you’ve finished the above steps and pushed your changes, other users of the project only need to fetch the repository and run `carthage bootstrap` to get started with the frameworks you’ve added.\n\n### Adding frameworks to unit tests or a framework\n\nUsing Carthage for the dependencies of any arbitrary target is fairly similar to [using Carthage for an application](#adding-frameworks-to-an-application). The main difference lies in how the frameworks are actually set up and linked in Xcode.\n\nBecause unit test targets are missing the _Linked Frameworks and Libraries_ section in their _General_ settings tab, you must instead drag the [built frameworks][Carthage/Build] to the _Link Binaries With Libraries_ build phase.\n\nIn the Test target under the _Build Settings_ tab, add `@loader_path/Frameworks` to the _Runpath Search Paths_ if it isn't already present.\n\nIn rare cases, you may want to also copy each dependency into the build product (e.g., to embed dependencies within the outer framework, or make sure dependencies are present in a test bundle). To do this, create a new _Copy Files_ build phase with the _Frameworks_ destination, then add the framework reference there as well. You shouldn't use the `carthage copy-frameworks` command since test bundles don't need frameworks stripped, and running concurrent instances of `copy-frameworks` (with parallel builds turn on) is not supported.\n\n### Upgrading frameworks\n\nIf you’ve modified your [Cartfile][], or you want to update to the newest versions of each framework (subject to the requirements you’ve specified), simply run the `carthage update` command again.\n\nIf you only want to update one, or specific, dependencies, pass them as a space-separated list to the `update` command. e.g.\n\n```\ncarthage update Box\n```\n\nor\n\n```\ncarthage update Box Result\n```\n\n##### Experimental Resolver\n\nA rewrite of the logic for upgrading frameworks was done with the aim of increasing speed and reducing memory usage. It is currently an opt-in feature. It can be used by passing `--new-resolver` to the update command, e.g.,\n\n```\ncarthage update --new-resolver Box\n```\n\nIf you are experiencing performance problems during updates, please give the new resolver a try\n\n\n### Nested dependencies\n\nIf the framework you want to add to your project has dependencies explicitly listed in a [Cartfile][], Carthage will automatically retrieve them for you. You will then have to **drag them yourself into your project** from the [Carthage/Build] folder.\n\nIf the embedded framework in your project has dependencies to other frameworks you must  **link them to application target** (even if application target does not have dependency to that frameworks and never uses them).\n\n### Using submodules for dependencies\n\nBy default, Carthage will directly [check out][Carthage/Checkouts] dependencies’ source files into your project folder, leaving you to commit or ignore them as you choose. If you’d like to have dependencies available as Git submodules instead (perhaps so you can commit and push changes within them), you can run `carthage update` or `carthage checkout` with the `--use-submodules` flag.\n\nWhen run this way, Carthage will write to your repository’s `.gitmodules` and `.git/config` files, and automatically update the submodules when the dependencies’ versions change.\n\n### Automatically rebuilding dependencies\n\nIf you want to work on your dependencies during development, and want them to be automatically rebuilt when you build your parent project, you can add a Run Script build phase that invokes Carthage like so:\n\n```sh\n/usr/local/bin/carthage build --platform \"$PLATFORM_NAME\" --project-directory \"$SRCROOT\"\n```\n\nNote that you should be [using submodules](#using-submodules-for-dependencies) before doing this, because plain checkouts [should not be modified][Carthage/Checkouts] directly.\n\n### Caching builds\n\nBy default Carthage will rebuild a dependency regardless of whether it's the same resolved version as before. Passing the `--cache-builds` will cause carthage to avoid rebuilding a dependency if it can. See information on [version files][VersionFile] for details on how Carthage performs this caching.\n\nNote: At this time `--cache-builds` is incompatible with `--use-submodules`. Using both will result in working copy and committed changes to your submodule dependency not being correctly rebuilt. See [#1785](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/1785) for details.\n\n### Bash/Zsh/Fish completion\n\nAuto completion of Carthage commands and options are available as documented in [Bash/Zsh/Fish Completion][Bash/Zsh/Fish Completion].\n\n## Supporting Carthage for your framework\n\n**Carthage only officially supports dynamic frameworks**. Dynamic frameworks can be used on any version of OS X, but only on **iOS 8 or later**. Additionally, since version 0.30.0 Carthage supports **static** frameworks.\n\nBecause Carthage has no centralized package list, and no project specification format, **most frameworks should build automatically**.\n\nThe specific requirements of any framework project are listed below.\n\n### Share your Xcode schemes\n\nCarthage will only build Xcode schemes that are shared from your `.xcodeproj`. You can see if all of your intended schemes build successfully by running `carthage build --no-skip-current`, then checking the [Carthage/Build][] folder.\n\nIf an important scheme is not built when you run that command, open Xcode and make sure that the [scheme is marked as _Shared_](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/xcode_guide-continuous_integration/ConfigureBots.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013292-CH9-SW3), so Carthage can discover it.\n\n\n### Resolve build failures\n\nIf you encounter build failures in `carthage build --no-skip-current`, try running `xcodebuild -scheme SCHEME -workspace WORKSPACE build` or `xcodebuild -scheme SCHEME -project PROJECT build` (with the actual values) and see if the same failure occurs there. This should hopefully yield enough information to resolve the problem.\n\nIf you have multiple versions of the Apple developer tools installed (an Xcode beta, for example), use `xcode-select` to change which version Carthage uses.\n\nIf you’re still not able to build your framework with Carthage, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/new) and we’d be happy to help!\n\n### Tag stable releases\n\nCarthage determines which versions of your framework are available by searching through the tags published on the repository, and trying to interpret each tag name as a [semantic version](https://semver.org/). For example, in the tag `v1.2`, the semantic version is 1.2.0.\n\nTags without any version number, or with any characters following the version number (e.g., `1.2-alpha-1`) are currently unsupported, and will be ignored.\n\n### Archive prebuilt frameworks into zip files\n\nCarthage can automatically use prebuilt frameworks, instead of building from scratch, if they are attached to a [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases/) on your project’s repository or via a binary project definition file.\n\nTo offer prebuilt frameworks for a specific tag, the binaries for _all_ supported platforms should be zipped up together into _one_ archive, and that archive should be attached to a published Release corresponding to that tag. The attachment should include `.framework` in its name (e.g., `ReactiveCocoa.framework.zip`), to indicate to Carthage that it contains binaries. The directory structure of the archive is free form but, __frameworks should only appear once in the archive__ as they will be copied\nto `Carthage/Build/<platform>` based on their name (e.g. `ReactiveCocoa.framework`).\n\nTo offer prebuilt XCFrameworks, build with `--use-xcframeworks` and follow the same process to zip up all XCFrameworks into one archive. Include `.xcframework` in the attachment name. Starting in version 0.38.0, Carthage prefers downloading `.xcframework` attachments when `--use-xcframeworks` is passed.\n\nYou can perform the archiving operation with carthage itself using:\n\n```sh\n-carthage build --no-skip-current\n-carthage archive YourFrameworkName\n```\n\nor alternatively\n\n```sh\ncarthage build --archive\n```\n\nDraft Releases will be automatically ignored, even if they correspond to the desired tag.\n\n#### Use travis-ci to upload your tagged prebuilt frameworks\n\nIt is possible to use travis-ci in order to build and upload your tagged releases.\n\n1. [Install travis CLI](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#installation) with `gem install travis`\n1. [Setup](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/) travis-ci for your repository (Steps 1 and 2)\n1. Create `.travis.yml` file at the root of your repository based on that template. Set `FRAMEWORK_NAME` to the correct value.\n\n\tReplace PROJECT_PLACEHOLDER and SCHEME_PLACEHOLDER\n\n\tIf you are using a *workspace* instead of a *project* remove the xcode_project line and uncomment the xcode_workspace line.\n\n\tThe project should be in the format: MyProject.xcodeproj\n\n\tThe workspace should be in the format: MyWorkspace.xcworkspace\n\n\tFeel free to update the `xcode_sdk` value to another SDK, note that testing on iphoneos SDK would require you to upload a code signing identity\n\n\tFor more informations you can visit [travis docs for objective-c projects](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/objective-c)\n\n\t```YAML\n\tlanguage: objective-c\n\tosx_image: xcode7.3\n\txcode_project: <PROJECT_PLACEHOLDER>\n\t# xcode_workspace: <WORKSPACE_PLACEHOLDER>\n\txcode_scheme: <SCHEME_PLACEHOLDER>\n\txcode_sdk: iphonesimulator9.3\n\tenv:\n\t  global:\n\t    - FRAMEWORK_NAME=<THIS_IS_A_PLACEHOLDER_REPLACE_ME>\n\tbefore_install:\n\t  - brew update\n\t  - brew outdated carthage || brew upgrade carthage\n\tbefore_script:\n\t  # bootstrap the dependencies for the project\n\t  # you can remove if you don't have dependencies\n\t  - carthage bootstrap\n\tbefore_deploy:\n\t  - carthage build --no-skip-current\n\t  - carthage archive $FRAMEWORK_NAME\n\t```\n1. Run `travis setup releases`, follow documentation [here](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/)\n\n\tThis command will encode your GitHub credentials into the `.travis.yml` file in order to let travis upload the release to GitHub.com\n\tWhen prompted for the file to upload, enter `$FRAMEWORK_NAME.framework.zip`\n\n1. Update the deploy section to run on tags:\n\n\tIn `.travis.yml` locate:\n\n\t```YAML\n\ton:\n\t  repo: repo/repo\n\t```\n\n\tAnd add `tags: true` and `skip_cleanup: true`:\n\n\t```YAML\n\tskip_cleanup: true\n\ton:\n\t  repo: repo/repo\n\t  tags: true\n\t```\n\n\tThat will let travis know to create a deployment when a new tag is pushed and prevent travis to cleanup the generated zip file\n\n### Build static frameworks to speed up your app’s launch times\n\nIf you embed many dynamic frameworks into your app, its pre-main launch times may be quite slow. Carthage is able to help mitigate this by building your dynamic frameworks as static frameworks instead. Static frameworks can be linked directly into your application or merged together into a larger dynamic framework with a few simple modifications to your workflow, which can result in dramatic reductions in pre-main launch times.\n\n#### Carthage 0.30.0 or higher\n\nSince version 0.30.0 Carthage project rolls out support for statically linked frameworks written in Swift or Objective-C, support for which has been introduced in Xcode 9.4. Please note however that it specifically says *frameworks*, hence Darwin bundles with **.framework** extension and statically linked object archives inside. Carthage does not currently support static *library* schemes, nor are there any plans to introduce their support in the future.\n\nThe workflow differs barely:\n\n- You still need to tick your Carthage-compliant project's schemes as *shared* in *Product > Scheme > Manage Schemes...*, just as with dynamic binaries\n- You still need to link against static **.frameworks** in your project's *Build Phases* just as with dynamic binaries\n\nHowever:\n\n- In your Carthage-compliant project's Cocoa Framework target's *Build Settings*, *Linking* section, set **Mach-O Type** to **Static Library**\n- Your statically linked frameworks will be built at *./Carthage/Build/$(PLATFORM_NAME)/Static*\n- You should not add any of static frameworks as input/output files in **carthage copy-frameworks** *Build Phase*\n\n#### Carthage 0.29.0 or lower\n\nSee the [StaticFrameworks][StaticFrameworks] doc for details.\n\n*Please note that a few caveats apply to this approach:*\n- Swift static frameworks are not officially supported by Apple\n- This is an advanced workflow that is not built into Carthage, YMMV\n\n### Declare your compatibility\n\nWant to advertise that your project can be used with Carthage? You can add a compatibility badge:\n\n[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)\n\n… to your `README`, by simply inserting the following Markdown:\n\n```markdown\n[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)\n```\n## Known issues\n\n##### DWARFs symbol problem\nPre-built framework cannot be debugged using step execution on other machine than on which the framework was built. Simply `carthage bootstrap/build/update --no-use-binaries` should fix this, but for more automated workaround, see [#924](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/924). Dupe [rdar://23551273](http://www.openradar.me/23551273) if you want Apple to fix the root cause of this problem.\n\n## CarthageKit\n\nMost of the functionality of the `carthage` command line tool is actually encapsulated in a framework named CarthageKit.\n\nIf you’re interested in using Carthage as part of another tool, or perhaps extending the functionality of Carthage, take a look at the [CarthageKit][] source code to see if the API fits your needs.\n\n## Differences between Carthage and CocoaPods\n\n[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a long-standing dependency manager for Cocoa. So why was Carthage created?\n\nFirstly, CocoaPods (by default) automatically creates and updates an Xcode workspace for your application and all dependencies. Carthage builds framework binaries using `xcodebuild`, but leaves the responsibility of integrating them up to the user. CocoaPods’ approach is easier to use, while Carthage’s is flexible and unintrusive.\n\nThe goal of CocoaPods is listed in its [README](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/1703a3464674baecf54bd7e766f4b37ed8fc43f7/README.md) as follows:\n\n> … to improve discoverability of, and engagement in, third party open-source libraries, by creating a more centralized ecosystem.\n\nBy contrast, Carthage has been created as a _decentralized_ dependency manager. There is no central list of projects, which reduces maintenance work and avoids any central point of failure. However, project discovery is more difficult—users must resort to GitHub’s [Trending](https://github.com/trending?l=swift) pages or similar.\n\nCocoaPods projects must also have what’s known as a [podspec](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html) file, which includes metadata about the project and specifies how it should be built. Carthage uses `xcodebuild` to build dependencies, instead of integrating them into a single workspace, it doesn’t have a similar specification file but your dependencies must include their own Xcode project that describes how to build their products.\n\nUltimately, we created Carthage because we wanted the simplest tool possible—a dependency manager that gets the job done without taking over the responsibility of Xcode, and without creating extra work for framework authors. CocoaPods offers many amazing features that Carthage will never have, at the expense of additional complexity.\n\n## License\n\nCarthage is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).\n\nHeader backdrop photo is released under the [CC BY-NC-SA 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/) license.
