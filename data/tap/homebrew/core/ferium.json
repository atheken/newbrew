Listing mods\n      ![Listing Mods](media/list.png)\n    - Listing mods verbosely\n      ![Listing Mods Verbosely](media/list%20verbose.png)\n    - Upgrading mods/modpacks\n      ![Upgrading Mods/Modpacks](media/upgrade.png)\n  </details>\n\n- <details>\n    <summary>It's super fast due to multithreading for network intensive tasks</summary>\n\n    Your results may vary depending on your internet connection.\n\n    It downloads my modpack [Kupfur](https://github.com/theRookieCoder/Kupfur) with 79 mods in 15 seconds:\n\n    https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60034030/212559027-2df10657-82a3-407c-875d-9981628bbfc2.mp4\n\n    It downloads [MMTP](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/mats-mega-tech-pack), as very large modpack with around 400 mods, in just under a minute:\n\n    https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60034030/201951498-62d1e6d9-8edb-4399-b02c-f2562ae566e3.mp4\n  </details>\n\n- Upgrade all your mods to the latest compatible version in one command, `ferium upgrade`\n  - Ferium checks that the version being downloaded is the latest one compatible with the configured mod loader and Minecraft version\n- Download and install the latest version of your modpack in one command, `ferium modpack upgrade`\n- Create multiple profiles and configure different mod loaders, Minecraft versions, output directories, and mods for each\n\n## Installation\n\nFerium builds from GitHub Releases do not require any external dependencies at runtime.  \nIf you compile from source on Linux, using GCC to build will result in binaries that require GCC to be available at runtime.  \nOn Linux, the regular version requires some sort of desktop environment that offers an XDG Desktop Portal to show folder pickers.\nThe `nogui` versions do not need this as they won't have a GUI folder picker, making these variants suitable for server use.\n\n### Packages\n\n[Coming to more package managers soon](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/ferium/discussions/292)\n\n#### [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org) for _Arch Linux_\n\n[![AUR](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/aur/ferium.svg)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?K=ferium)\n\n> **Warning**  \n> From-source builds will install the Rust toolchain and GCC\n\n| Installation method                             | GUI file dialogue                                                       | No GUI                                                      |\n| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Install pre-built binaries from GitHub Releases | **[ferium-gui-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ferium-gui-bin)** | [ferium-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ferium-bin) |\n| Build from source at the latest tag             | [ferium-gui](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ferium-gui)             | [ferium](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ferium)         |\n| Build from source using the latest commit       | [ferium-gui-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ferium-gui-git)     | [ferium-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ferium-git) |\n\n#### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for _macOS_ or _Linux_\n[![Homebrew](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/homebrew/ferium.svg)](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ferium)\n```bash\nbrew install ferium\n```\n\n#### [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) for _Windows_\n[![Scoop](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/scoop/ferium.svg)](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=ferium&id=d17eaa5fe92af6d5eddb853f06bf27d162cadbba)\n```bash\nscoop bucket add games\nscoop install ferium\n```\n\n#### [Pacstall](https://pacstall.dev) for _Ubuntu_\n[![Pacstall](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/pacstall/ferium.svg)](https://pacstall.dev/packages/ferium-bin)\n```bash\npacstall -I ferium-bin\n```\n\n#### [Nixpkgs](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nixpkgs) for _NixOS_ or _Linux_\n[![Nixpkgs unstable](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/nix_unstable/ferium.svg)](https://search.nixos.org/packages?show=ferium&channel=unstable)  \n**Note** See package page for installation instructions\n\n#### [crates.io](https://crates.io) for the _Rust toolchain_\n[![crates.io](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/crates_io/rust:ferium.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/ferium)\n```bash\ncargo install ferium\n```\n> **Warning**  \n> Remember to use an add-on like [cargo-update](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-update) to keep ferium updated to the latest version!\n\n#### GitHub Releases\n[![GitHub Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/gorilla-devs/ferium?color=bright-green&label=github%20releases)](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/ferium/releases)\n> **Warning**  \n> You will have to manually download and install every time there is a new update\n\n1. Download the asset suitable for your operating system from the [latest release](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/ferium/releases/latest)\n2. Unzip the file and move it to a folder in your path, e.g. `~/bin`\n3. Remember to check the releases page for any updates!\n\n## Overview / Help Page\n\n> **Note**  \n> A lot of ferium's backend is in a separate project [libium](https://github.com/theRookieCoder/libium).  \n> It deals with things such as the config, adding mod(pack)s, upgrading, file pickers, etc.\n\n### Config File Location\n\nFerium stores profile and modpack information in its config file. By default, this is located at `~/.config/ferium/config.json`.  \nYou can change this in 2 ways, setting the `FERIUM_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable, or setting the `--config-file` global flag.\nThe flag always takes precedence.\n\nYou can also set a custom CurseForge API key or GitHub personal access token using the `CURSEFORGE_API_KEY` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variables or the `--curseforge_api_key` and `--github-token` global flags respectively.\nAgain, the flags take precedence.\n\n### First Startup\n\nYou can either have your own set of mods in what is called a 'profile', or install a modpack.\n\n- Create a new profile by running `ferium profile create` and entering the details for your profile\n  - Then, [add your mods](#adding-mods) using `ferium add`\n  - Finally, download your mods using `ferium upgrade`\n- [Add a modpack](#adding-modpacks) by running `ferium modpack add <project_id>`\n  - After which, run `ferium modpack upgrade` to download and install the modpack\n\n### Adding Mods\n\n- Modrinth\n  - `ferium add project_id`\n  - Where `project_id` is the slug or project ID of the mod\n    - For example, [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) has the slug `sodium` and project ID `AANobbMI`\n    - You can find the slug in the website URL (`modrinth.com/mod/<slug>`), and the project ID at the bottom of the left sidebar under 'Technical information'\n  - So to add [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), you can run `ferium add sodium` or `ferium add AANobbMI`\n- CurseForge\n  - `ferium add project_id`\n  - Where `project_id` is the project ID of the mod\n    - For example, [Terralith](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terralith) has the project id `513688`\n    - You can find the project id at the top of the right sidebar under 'About Project'\n  - So to add [Terralith](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terralith), you should run `ferium add 513688`\n- GitHub\n  - `ferium add owner/name`\n  - Where `owner` is the username of the owner of the repository and `name` is the name of the repository (both case-insensitive)\n    - For example [Sodium's repository](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric) has the id `CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric`\n    - You can find these at the top left part of the repository's page as a big 'owner / name'\n  - So to add [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric), you should run `ferium add CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric` (again, case-insensitive)\n  - **Note**  \n    The GitHub repository has to release JAR files in their Releases for ferium to download, or else it will refuse to be added\n\n#### External Mods\n\nIf you want to use files that are not downloadable by ferium, place them in the `user` folder in the output directory. Files here will be copied to the output directory when upgrading.\n\n> **Warning**  \n> Profiles using the Quilt mod loader will not copy their user mods, this is because Quilt loads mods from nested directories (such as the user folder) for loader versions above `0.18.1-beta.3`\n\n### Adding Modpacks\n\n- Modrinth Modpacks\n  - `ferium modpack add project_id`\n  - Where `project_id` is the slug or project ID of the modpack\n    - For example, [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) has the slug `fabulously-optimized` and project ID `1KVo5zza`\n    - You can find the slug in the website URL (`modrinth.com/modpack/<slug>`), and the project id at the bottom of the left sidebar under 'Technical information'\n  - So to add [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), you can run `ferium modpack add fabulously-optimized` or `ferium modpack add 1KVo5zza`\n- CurseForge Modpacks\n  - `ferium modpack add project_id`\n  - Where `project_id` is the project ID of the modpack\n    - For example, [Fabulously Optimized](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized) has the project ID `396246`\n    - You can find the project ID at the top of the right sidebar under 'About Project'\n  - So to add [Fabulously Optimized](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized), you should run `ferium modpack add 396246`\n\n### Upgrading Mods\n\n> **Note**  \n> If your output directory is not empty when setting it, ferium will offer to create a backup.\n> Please do so if it contains any files you would like to keep.\n\nNow after adding all your mods, run `ferium upgrade` to download all of them to your output directory.\nThis defaults to `.minecraft/mods`, where `.minecraft` is the default Minecraft resources directory. You don't need to worry about this if you play with Mojang's launcher (unless you changed the resources directory).\nYou can choose to pick a custom output directory during profile creation or [change it later](#configure-1).\n\nIf ferium fails to download a mod, it will print its name in red and give the reason. It will continue downloading the rest of the mods and will exit with an error.\n\n> **Warning**  \n> When upgrading, any files not downloaded by ferium will be moved to the `.old` folder in the output directory\n\n### Upgrading Modpacks\n\n> **Note**  \n> If your output directory's `mods` and `resourcepacks` are not empty when setting it, ferium will offer to create a backup.\n> Please do so if it contains any files you would like to keep\n\nNow after adding your modpack, run `ferium modpack upgrade` to download the modpack to your output directory.\nThis defaults to `.minecraft`, which is the default Minecraft resources directory. You don't need to worry about this if you play with Mojang's launcher (unless you changed the resources directory).\nYou can choose to pick a custom output directory when adding modpacks or [change it later](#configure).\n\nIf ferium fails to download a mod, it will print its name in red and give the reason. It will continue downloading the rest of the mods and will exit with an error.\n\n> **Warning**  \n> If you choose to install modpack overrides, your existing configs may be overwritten\n\n### Managing Mods\n\nYou can see all the mods in your current profile by running `ferium list`. If you want to see more information about them, you can run `ferium list -v` or `ferium list --verbose`.\n\nYou can remove any of your mods by running `ferium remove`, selecting the ones you would like to remove by using the space key, and pressing enter once you're done. You can also provide the names or IDs of the mods to remove as arguments.\n\n> **Warning**  \n> Mod names with spaces have to be given in quotes (`ferium remove \"ok zoomer\"`) or the spaces should be escaped (`ferium remove ok\\ zoomer`).  \n> Mod names and GitHub repository identifiers are case insensitive.\n\n#### Check Overrides\n\nIf some mod is compatible with your profile but ferium does not download it, [create an issue](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/ferium/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug-report.md) if you think it's a bug. You can disable the game version or mod loader checks by using the `--dont-check-game-version` and/or `--dont-check-mod-loader` flags when adding the mod, or manually setting `check_game_version` or `check_mod_loader` to false for the specific mod in the config file.\n\nFor example, [Just Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) does not specify the mod loader for older minecraft versions such as `1.12.2`. In this case, you would add JEI by running `ferium add 238222 --dont-check-mod-loader` so that the mod loader check is disabled.\nYou can also manually disable the mod loader (and/or game version) check(s) in the config like so\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"Just Enough Items (JEI)\",\n    \"identifier\": {\n        \"CurseForgeProject\": 238222\n    },\n    \"check_mod_loader\": false\n}\n```\n\n### Managing Modpacks\n\n#### Add\n\nWhen adding a modpack, you will configure the following:\n\n- Output directory\n  - This defaults to `.minecraft`, which is the default Minecraft resources directory. You don't need to worry about this if you play with Mojang's launcher (unless you changed the resources directory)\n- Whether to install modpack overrides\n\nYou can also provide these settings as flags.\n\nFerium will automatically switch to the newly added modpack.\n\n#### Configure\n\nYou can configure these same settings afterwards by running `ferium modpack configure`.\nAgain, you can provide these settings as flags.\n\n#### Manage\n\nYou can see all the modpacks you have configured by running `ferium modpack list`.\nSwitch between your modpacks using `ferium modpack switch`.\nDelete a modpack by running `ferium modpack delete` and selecting the modpack you want to delete.\n\n### Profiles\n\n#### Create\n\nYou can create a profile by running `ferium profile create` and configuring the following:\n\n- Output directory\n  - This defaults to `.minecraft/mods` where `.minecraft` is the default Minecraft resources directory. You don't need to worry about this if you play with Mojang's launcher (unless you changed the resources directory)\n- Name of the profile\n- Minecraft version\n- Mod loader\n\nYou can also provide these settings as flags.\n\nIf you want to copy the mods from another profile, provide the `--import` flag.\nYou can also directly provide the profile name to the flag if you don't want a profile picker to be shown.\n\nFerium will automatically switch to the newly created profile.\n\n#### Configure\n\nYou can configure these same settings afterwards by running `ferium profile configure`.\nAgain, you can provide these settings as flags.\n\n#### Manage\n\nYou can see all the profiles you have by running `ferium profile list`.\nSwitch between your profiles using `ferium profile switch`.\nDelete a profile by running `ferium profile delete` and selecting the profile you want to delete.\n\n## Feature Requests\n\nIf you would like to make a feature request, check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/ferium/issues) to see if the feature has already been added or is planned.\nIf not, [create a new issue](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/ferium/issues/new/choose).\n\n## Building from Source or Working on ferium\n\nFirstly you need the Rust toolchain, which includes `cargo`, `rustup`, etc. You can install these from [the Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).\nYou can manually run cargo commands, but I recommend [`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_4.html), a command runner that is basically a much better version of `make`.\n\nTo build the project and install it to your Cargo binary directory, clone the project and run `just install`.\nIf you want to install it for testing purposes run `just` (alias to `just install-dev`), which builds in debug mode.\n\nYou can run integration tests using `cargo test`, linters using `cargo clippy`, and delete all build and test artefacts using `just clean`.\n\nIf you would like to see instructions for building for specific targets (e.g. Linux ARM), have a look at the [workflow file](.github/workflows/build.yml). If you're still confused, [create a discussion](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/ferium/discussions/new?category=q-a) and I will help you out."
