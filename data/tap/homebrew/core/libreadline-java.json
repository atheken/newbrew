  "readme": "This is my \"port\" of GNU-Readline to Java. Actually, it is a crude wrapper\nusing the Java Native Interface (JNI).\n\nStarting from version 0.6, alternative libraries are supported. Currently\nonly Editline is implemented, but adding support for other implementations\nshould be easy.\nFrom 0.6 on, JavaReadline also has a fallback solution (System.in) for\nplatforms without Readline or Editline support, making your programs portable\nagain.\n\nThis version implements basic readline functionality like line editing and\nfilename completion, which should be just enough for normal use. Not all\nfunctionality is available with all implementations.\n\nVarious people contributed code (see the file NEWS for details).\nSince I changed some of the code, all bugs are my fault and bugreports\nshould be adressed to me.\n\nThe binary distribution contains the API documentation, a JAR with the\nReadline class and the shared library libJavaReadline.so.\n\nThe source distribution contains all the source (I hope this doesn't surprise\nyou ;-) and a system of makefiles. You need the JDK to compile it.\n\n\nLICENSING ISSUES\n================\n\nAlthough JavaReadline is distributed under the LGPL, the underlying\nReadline library is GPL code. The consequence is, that any program\nlinking with JavaReadline+Readline, will fall under the GPL.\n\nThere is a Readline replacement called Editline with a more liberal\nlicense. Use that library if you want to distribute your program\nunder the LGPL instead of the GPL.\n\nYou can fetch the Editline stuff at http://packages.debian.org. You\nneed libedit2 and libedit-dev. Source code is also available, although\nI must admit I did not succeed in compiling it on my non-BSD and\nnon-Debian system :-(\n\nA second Readline replacement is called Getline. This is a very minimal\nReadline-clone with a liberal license, and the source-code is provided\nin the java-readline distribution. It has the advantage that it\ncompiles natively on Windows.\n\n\nCOMPILATION\n===========\n\nCompilation should be no problem. Try \"make\". You should set the\nvariable JAVA_HOME (or edit the makefile).\nJAVAC and JAVAC_OPT can also be set in the environment or from the\nmake commandline.\n\nIf you want Editline support, use \"make T_LIBS=JavaEditline\". Getline support\nis selected with \"make T_LIBS=JavaGetline\".\n\nGetline support is also available for (native) WIN32. To build it from\nsource, you need the cygwin-environment (only necessary because we still\nuse GNU-make) and a native C-compiler. All necessary variables are configured\nin the toplevel Makefile. Before running make, set the WIN32-variable to MSC:\n\n> WIN32=MSC make\n\nA ready-to-use DLL is in the contrib/win32 directory. Since this feature\nis experimental, your feedback is appreciated. If you figure out how to\nlink JavaReadline with cygwin, please let me know as well (some stubs\nare already built into the makefiles).\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n============\n\nCopy the files libJava*.so to one of your library directories or add\nthe directory where you put libJava*.so to LD_LIBARY_PATH. Also, add\njava_readline.jar to your CLASSPATH. After building the jar and the shared\nlibrary, you can run a program with something like:\n\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib java -cp java_readline.jar org.foo.bar.MyClass\n\nassuming that you put libJava*.so into /usr/lib.\n\n\nDEBIAN\n======\n\nThanks to Ben Burton, Debian-packages for JavaReadline are available!\n\n\nSUPPORT\n=======\n\nIf you think you found a bug or want to contribute some code, please open\nan issue or send a pull request.\n\nThis software was originally written by Bernhard Bablok, who has retired\nfrom maintaining. It is now maintained by Andrew Clemons."
