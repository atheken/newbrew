  "readme": "# SkyWalking Eyes\n\n<img src=\"http://skywalking.apache.org/assets/logo.svg\" alt=\"Sky Walking logo\" height=\"90px\" align=\"right\" />\n\nA full-featured license tool to check and fix license headers and resolve dependencies' licenses.\n\n[![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/asfskywalking.svg?style=for-the-badge&label=Follow&logo=twitter)](https://twitter.com/AsfSkyWalking)\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use License-Eye in GitHub Actions or in your local machine.\n\n### GitHub Actions\n\nFirst of all, add a `.licenserc.yaml` in the root of your project, for Apache Software Foundation projects, the following configuration should be enough.\n\n> **Note**: The full configurations can be found in [the configuration section](#configurations).\n\n```yaml\nheader:\n  license:\n    spdx-id: Apache-2.0\n    copyright-owner: Apache Software Foundation\n\n  paths-ignore:\n    - 'dist'\n    - 'licenses'\n    - '**/*.md'\n    - 'LICENSE'\n    - 'NOTICE'\n\n  comment: on-failure\n\n# If you don't want to check dependencies' license compatibility, remove the following part\ndependency:\n  files:\n    - pom.xml           # If this is a maven project.\n    - Cargo.toml        # If this is a rust project.\n    - package.json      # If this is a npm project.\n    - go.mod            # If this is a Go project.\n```\n\n#### Check License Headers\n\nTo check license headers in GitHub Actions, add a step in your GitHub workflow.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Check License Header\n  uses: apache/skywalking-eyes/header@main      # always prefer to use a revision instead of `main`.\n  # with:\n      # log: debug # optional: set the log level. The default value is `info`.\n      # config: .licenserc.yaml # optional: set the config file. The default value is `.licenserc.yaml`.\n      # token: # optional: the token that license eye uses when it needs to comment on the pull request. Set to empty (\"\") to disable commenting on pull request. The default value is ${{ github.token }}\n      # mode: # optional: Which mode License-Eye should be run in. Choices are `check` or `fix`. The default value is `check`.\n```\n\n#### Fix License Headers\n\nBy default the action runs License-Eye in check mode, which will raise an error\nif any of the processed files are missing license headers. If `mode` is set to\n`fix`, the action will instead apply the license header to any processed file\nthat is missing a license header. The fixed files can then be pushed back to the\npull request using another GitHub action. For example:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Fix License Header\n  uses: apache/skywalking-eyes/header@main\n  with:\n    mode: fix\n- name: Apply Changes\n  uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v4\n  env:\n      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  with:\n    author_name: License Bot\n    author_email: license_bot@github.com\n    message: 'Automatic application of license header'\n```\n\n> **Warning**: The exit code of fix mode is always 0 and can not be used to block CI\nstatus. Consider running the action in check mode if you would like CI to fail\nwhen a file is missing a license header.\n\n> **Note**: In 0.3.0 and earlier versions, GitHub Actions `apache/skywalking-eyes`\n> only works for header check/fix, since 0.4.0, we have a dedicate GitHub Actions\n> `apache/skywalking-eyes/header` for header check/fix and a GitHub Actions\n> `apache/skywalking-eyes/dependency` for dependency resolve/check.\n> Now `apache/skywalking-eyes` is equivalent to `apache/skywalking-eyes/header` in\n> order not to break existing usages of `apache/skywalking-eyes`.\n\n#### Check Dependencies' License\n\nTo check dependencies license in GitHub Actions, add a step in your GitHub workflow.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Check Dependencies' License\n  uses: apache/skywalking-eyes/dependency@main      # always prefer to use a revision instead of `main`.\n  # with:\n      # log: debug # optional: set the log level. The default value is `info`.\n      # config: .licenserc.yaml # optional: set the config file. The default value is `.licenserc.yaml`.\n      # mode: # optional: Which mode License-Eye should be run in. Choices are `check` or `resolve`. The default value is `check`.\n      # flags: # optional: Extra flags appended to the command, for example, `--summary=path/to/template.tmpl`\n```\n\n### Docker Image\n\n```shell\ndocker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace apache/skywalking-eyes header check\ndocker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace apache/skywalking-eyes header fix\n```\n\n### Docker Image from the latest codes\n\nFor users and developers who want to help to test the latest codes on main branch, we publish a Docker image to the GitHub\nContainer Registry for every commit in main branch, tagged with the commit sha. If it's the latest commit in main\nbranch, it's also tagged with `latest`.\n\n**Note**: these Docker images are not official Apache releases. For official releases, please refer to\n[the download page](https://skywalking.apache.org/downloads/#SkyWalkingEyes) for executable binary and\n[the Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/skywalking-eyes) for Docker images.\n\n```shell\ndocker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace ghcr.io/apache/skywalking-eyes/license-eye header check\ndocker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace ghcr.io/apache/skywalking-eyes/license-eye header fix\n```\n\n### Compile from Source\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes\ncd skywalking-eyes\nmake build\n```\n\nIf you have the Go SDK installed, you can also use the `go install` command to install the latest code.\n\n```bash\ngo install github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes/cmd/license-eye@latest\n```\n\n#### Check License Header\n\n```bash\nlicense-eye -c test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_check.yaml header check\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Header Check Result</summary>\n\n```\nINFO Loading configuration from file: test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_check.yaml\nINFO Totally checked 30 files, valid: 12, invalid: 12, ignored: 6, fixed: 0\nERROR the following files don't have a valid license header:\ntest/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.go\ntest/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.graphql\ntest/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.ini\ntest/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.java\ntest/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.md\ntest/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.php\ntest/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.py\ntest/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.sh\ntest/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.yaml\ntest/testdata/include_test/without_license/testcase.yml\ntest/testdata/test-spdx-asf.yaml\ntest/testdata/test-spdx.yaml\nexit status 1\n```\n\n</details>\n\n#### Fix License Header\n\n```bash\nbin/darwin/license-eye -c test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_fix.yaml header fix\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Header Fix Result</summary>\n\n```\nINFO Loading configuration from file: test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_fix.yaml\nINFO Totally checked 20 files, valid: 10, invalid: 10, ignored: 0, fixed: 10\n```\n\n</details>\n\n#### Resolve Dependencies' licenses\n\nThis command assists human audits of the dependencies licenses.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n

If you have multiple modules or packages in your project that have differing licenses, this section may contain a list of licenses:\n```yaml\nheader:\n  - path: \"/path/to/module/a\"\n    license:\n      spdx-id: Apache-2.0\n  - path: \"/path/to/module/b\"\n    license:\n      spdx-id: MPL-2.0\n```\n2. The [SPDX ID](https://spdx.org/licenses/) of the license, it’s convenient when your license is standard SPDX license, so that you can simply specify this identifier without copying the whole license `content` or `pattern`. This will be used as the content when `fix` command needs to insert a license header.\n3. The copyright owner to replace the `[owner]` in the `SPDX-ID` license template.\n4. The copyright software name to replace the `[software-name]` in the `SPDX-ID` license template.\n5. If you are not using the standard license text, you can paste your license text here, this will be used as the content when `fix` command needs to insert a license header, if both `license` and `SPDX-ID` are specified, `license` wins.\n6. The `pattern` is an optional regexp. You don’t need this if all the file headers are the same as `license` or the license of `SPDX-ID`, otherwise you need to compose a pattern that matches your existing license texts so that `license-eye` won't complain about the existing license headers. If you want to replace your existing license headers, you can compose a `pattern` that matches your existing license headers, and modify the `content` to what you want to have, then `license-eye header fix` would rewrite all the existing license headers to the wanted `content`.\n7. The `paths` are the path list that will be checked (and fixed) by license-eye, default is `['**']`. Formats like `**/*`.md and `**/bin/**` are supported.\n8. The `paths-ignore` are the path list that will be ignored by license-eye. By default, `.git` and the content in `.gitignore` will be inflated into the `paths-ignore` list.\n9. On what condition License-Eye will comment the check results on the pull request, `on-failure`, `always` or `never`. Options other than `never` require the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` to be set.\n10. The `license-location-threshold` specifies the index threshold where the license header can be located.\n11. The `language` is an optional configuration. You can set the language license header comment style. If it doesn't exist, it will use the default configuration at the `languages.yaml`. An [example](test/testdata/.licenserc_language_config_test.yaml) is to use block comment style for Go codes.\n12. Specify the programming language identifier. You can set different configurations for multiple languages.\n13. The `extensions` are the files with these extensions which the configuration will take effect.\n14. The `filenames` are the specified files which the configuration will take effect.\n15. The `comment_style_id` set the license header comment style, it's the `id` at the `styles.yaml`.\n16. The `dependency` section is configurations for resolving dependencies' licenses.\n17. The `files` are the files that declare the dependencies of a project, typically, `go.mod` in Go project, `pom.xml` in maven project, and `package.json` in NodeJS project. If it's a relative path, it's relative to the `.licenserc.yaml`.\n18. Declare the licenses which cannot be identified by this tool.\n19. The `name` of the dependency, The name is different for different projects, `PackagePath` in Go project, `GroupID:ArtifactID` in maven project, `PackageName` in NodeJS project. You can use file pattern as described in [the doc](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match).\n20. The `version` of the dependency, comma seperated string (such as `1.0,2.0,3.0`), if this is empty, it means all versions of the dependency.\n21. The [SPDX ID](https://spdx.org/licenses/) of the dependency license.\n22. The minimum percentage of the file that must contain license text for identifying a license, default is `75`.\n23. The dependencies that should be excluded when analyzing the licenses, this is useful when you declare the dependencies in `pom.xml` with `compile` scope but don't distribute them in package. (Note that non-`compile` scope dependencies are automatically excluded so you don't need to put them here).\n24. The transitive dependencies brought by <23> should be recursively excluded when analyzing the licenses, currently only maven project supports this.\n25. The copyright year of the work, if it's empty, it will be set to the current year. If you don't want to update the license year anually, you can set this to the year of the first publication of your work, such as `1994`, or `1994-2023`.\n\n**NOTE**: When the `SPDX-ID` is Apache-2.0 and the owner is Apache Software foundation, the content would be [a dedicated license](https://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html#headers) specified by the ASF, otherwise, the license would be [the standard one](https://www.apache.org/foundation/license-faq.html#Apply-My-Software).\n\n## Supported File Types\n\nThe `header check` command theoretically supports all kinds of file types, while the supported file types of `header fix` command can be found [in this YAML file](assets/languages.yaml). In the YAML file, if the language has a non-empty property `comment_style_id`, and the comment style id is declared in [the comment styles file](assets/styles.yaml), then the language is supported by `fix` command.\n\n- [assets/languages.yaml](assets/languages.yaml)\n\n  ```yaml\n  Java:\n    type: programming\n    tm_scope: source.java\n    ace_mode: java\n    codemirror_mode: clike\n    codemirror_mime_type: text/x-java\n    color: \"#b07219\"\n    extensions:\n      - \".java\"\n    language_id: 181\n    comment_style_id: SlashAsterisk\n  ```\n\n- [assets/styles.yaml](assets/styles.yaml)\n\n  ```yaml\n  - id: SlashAsterisk     # (i)\n    start: '/*'           # (ii)\n    middle: ' *'          # (iii)\n    end: ' */'            # (iv)\n  ```\n\n  1. The `comment_style_id` used in [assets/languages.yaml](assets/languages.yaml).\n  2. The leading characters of the starting of a block comment.\n  3. The leading characters of the middle lines of a block comment.\n  4. The leading characters of the ending line of a block comment.\n\n## Technical Documentation\n\n- There is an [activity diagram](./docs/header_fix_logic.svg) explaining the implemented license header\n  fixing mechanism in-depth.
