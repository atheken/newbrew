  "readme": "Akka [![Latest version](https://index.scala-lang.org/akka/akka/akka-actor/latest.svg)](https://index.scala-lang.org/akka/akka/akka-actor)\n====\n\nWe believe that writing correct concurrent & distributed, resilient and elastic applications is too hard.\nMost of the time it's because we are using the wrong tools and the wrong level of abstraction.\n\nAkka is here to change that.\n\nUsing the Actor Model we raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to build correct concurrent and scalable applications. This model is a perfect match for the principles laid out in the [Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/).\n\nFor resilience, we adopt the \"Let it crash\" model which the telecom industry has used with great success to build applications that self-heal and systems that never stop.\n\nActors also provide the abstraction for transparent distribution and the basis for truly scalable and fault-tolerant applications.\n\nLearn more at [akka.io](https://akka.io/).\n\nReference Documentation\n-----------------------\n\nThe reference documentation is available at [doc.akka.io](https://doc.akka.io),\nfor [Scala](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala.html) and [Java](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/java.html).\n\nCommunity\n---------\nYou can join these groups and chats to discuss and ask Akka related questions:\n\n- Forums: [discuss.akka.io](https://discuss.akka.io)\n- Chat room about *using* Akka: [![gitter: akka/akka](https://img.shields.io/badge/gitter%3A-akka%2Fakka-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://gitter.im/akka/akka)\n- Issue tracker: [![github: akka/akka](https://img.shields.io/badge/github%3A-issues-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues)\n\nIn addition to that, you may enjoy following:\n\n- The [news](https://akka.io/blog/news-archive.html) section of the page, which is updated whenever a new version is released\n- The [Akka Team Blog](https://akka.io/blog/article-archive.html)\n- [@akkateam](https://twitter.com/akkateam) on Twitter\n- Questions tagged [#akka on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/akka)\n- Projects built with Akka: [![akka-dependency-badge]][akka-dependency-scaladex]\n\nContributing\n------------\n**Contributions are *very* welcome!**\n\nIf you see an issue that you'd like to see fixed, or want to shape out some ideas,\nthe best way to make it happen is to help out by submitting a pull request implementing it.\nWe welcome contributions from all, even you are not yet familiar with this project,\nWe are happy to get you started, and will guide you through the process once you've submitted your PR.\n\n[![akka-dependency-badge]][akka-dependency-scaladex]\n\nRefer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more details about the workflow,\nand general hints on how to prepare your pull request.
