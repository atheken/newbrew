  "readme": "# completion-ruby: bash completion for Ruby-related commands\n\n**completion-ruby** is a set of [bash] scripts offering command-line\ncompletion for various [Ruby]-related commands and tools.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThese scripts depend on some utility functions from [bash-completion]. It\nshould be part of pretty much any modern Linux distribution, and you can\ninstall it on macOS using [Homebrew]:\n\n    brew install bash-completion\n\nSave the completion files somewhere (in the same directory) and add the\nfollowing line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`:\n\n    . /path/to/completion-ruby-all\n\nThe `completion-ruby-all` script loads all the completions it finds,\nbut only for the commands you appear to have installed.\nAlternatively, you can just save the specific scripts you wish, and\nsource them individually.\n\n\n## Why yet another completion script?\n\nBefore writing my own, I'd seen about five different scripts for `rake`\ncompletion. None of them, though, at the same time:\n\n* cached the task list for fast results;\n* invalidated said cache when the rakefile was modified;\n* worked properly with namespaces; and\n* worked on subdirectories of the project\n\n...among other minor quirks. While providing all of the above, a few other\nniceties were added, like command-line options completion and awareness of\ntask arguments.\n\nThis script is not perfect (for instance, it won't update the cache if\na dependency of the rakefile is updated; as a workaround, simply\n`touch Rakefile`), but it tries to cover all the most common cases without\novercomplicating or overthinking the code.\n\n\n## Testing\n\nTo ensure the scripts run across a wide range of versions of tools, some\nautomated tests are performed.\nPlease see the [tests directory](./tests#readme) for details.\n\n\n## License and website\n\nCopyright © 2008-2022 [Daniel Luz].\n\n**completion-ruby** is distributed under the [MIT license].\n\nThe source is available in a [Git] repository [at GitHub][repo].\n\nFor up-to-date information, visit [this project's permalink][permalink].\n\n[bash]: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/ (Bourne-Again Shell)\n[bash-completion]: https://github.com/scop/bash-completion\n[Ruby]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/         (Ruby Programming Language)\n[rake]: https://github.com/ruby/rake       (Rake — Ruby Make)\n[Daniel Luz]:  https://mernen.com/\n[MIT license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[Git]:  https://git-scm.com/               (Git — Fast Version Control System)\n[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh (Homebrew – The missing package manager for macOS)\n[repo]: https://github.com/mernen/completion-ruby\n[permalink]: https://mernen.com/projects/completion-ruby"
