I accept no responsibility for any damage this \nsoftware may or may not do to your system - you use it completely at your \nown risk. This software comes under the GPL license. See the COPYING file \nfor full legal details.\n------\n\nThis file contains:\n\n  1. Overview\n  2. Background\n  3. Features\n  4. Installing\n  5. Usage\n  6. Standard disclaimer\n  7. Bugs\n  8. Thanks\n\n\n1. OVERVIEW\n\nColortail works like tail but can optionally read one or more config files\nwhere it's specified which patterns results in which colors.\n\nColortail uses regular expressions (see regex(7)) to determine which lines and \nparts of lines to print in which colors.\n\n\n2. BACKGROUND\n\nMy thoughts about colortail started when I was running a \ntail -f -q /var/log/foo /var/log/bar in the background of my irc session and I\nwanted to quickly see if something strange was going on. I wanted different\nlines in different colors so it's easy to see what is happening. I searched on\nthe internet but didn't find any program that did what I wanted. So I started\nto code on colortail. Version 0.1 didn't use regular expressions but instead \nhad a somewhat DOSish config format with '*' and '?'. In 0.2 I changed to\nregular expressions. After 0.2 I didn't do much with colortail for a long\nwhile, but then I got a patch, that made it possible to print just parts of\nlines in a color, I got some new inspiration but because the code was a big\nmess I decided to do a rewrite in C++. I like the modularity that the C++\nclasses \"forces\" one to do. And because I've been brainwashed with Java in\nschool I find the object view the most natural.\n\n\n3. FEATURES\n\nOK, so what is this colortail thing good for?\n\nI can't say that colortail is a substitute for tail, not yet anyway. Right\nnow colortail lacks some major features the tail has. But I'll add this \nfeatures in the next releases.\n\nBUT, colortail has something that tail lacks. The ability to do colored output.\nHow may this come in handy? Well, it's mostly useful then looking at log files\n(it's what I use it for anyway, it may very well be other uses for it as well,\nif you have found something that colortail is useful for please send a mail \ntelling me of it). In the case of looking at log files I have configured\ncolortail to do this:\n(standard log file made my syslog (/var/log/messages)):\n\n(I split the line)\n\nAug  4 23:14:53 morrdusk kernel: Packet log: ppp-in DENY ppp0 PROTO=6 \n[-1--] [--2---] [--3---] [--4--] [---5-----] [-----6--------] [--5--]\n\nxxx.xx.xxx.xxx:xxxxx xxx.xxx.x.xxx:xx L=44 S=0x00 I=58022 F=0x4000 T=53\n[-----7------][--5-] [------7-----][----------------5-----------------]\n\nThe above is colorized as this:\nThe [-1-] part is in magenta\nThe [-2-] part is in cyan\nThe [-3-] part is in green\nThe [-4-] part is in yellow\nThe [-5-] part is in brightblue\nThe [-6-] part is in brightred\nThe [-7-] part is in brightyellow\n\n\nIt may be hard to imagine how it looks but I think it looks better than the\nall white output from tail. And I like to have all the more serious things \ncolored in bright red color. It then only takes a glance to see that\nsomething has happened and one can take a closer look at that line. I also have\nall ip addresses in bright yellow so that they are easy to see.\n\nThis is in no way hardcoded, all is controlled in the configuration files. \nThat can be one configuration file for each tail file then tailing more than \none file or if only one configuration file is given it's used as a global\nconfiguration file, affecting all the tail files.\n\n\n4. INSTALLING\n\nColortail should work on most unix system that have g++. I have developed it\non a Redhat linux system. \nI have integrated a bsd patch I got for 0.2 but I may have added some \nstrange code in the rewrite that bsd doesn't like.\nThere shouldn't be a problem on other systems, but if you have to change\nsomething to get it to work on your system, please send me a patch.\n\nTo install colortail this should be enough:\nFrom the toplevel colortail source tree directory:\n  ./configure\n  make\n  su\n  make install\n\nAfter that you may want to copy and edit the example config files to some\nother place. I have them in ~/.colortail/\n\nIf you don't have the GNU regex library, it can be found at\nftp.funet.fi/pub/gnu/prep/regex/\n\n\n5. USAGE\n\nMost options are easily understanded. The only somewhat strange option is\nthe -k option that specifies the config files so colortail knows what should\nbe printed in which color. \n\nIf only one config file and one or more tail files is given the config file \nis treated as a global one, i.e.\n\ncolortail -k conf.global file1 file2 file3\n\nMultiple config files are separated with a , and if one tail file shouldn't\nhave a config file just leave it blank, i.e.\n\ncolortail -k conf.file1,,conf.file3 file1 file2 file3\n\n\n6. STANDARD DISCLAIMER\n\nThe author don't take any responsibility for any damage this program may do.\nI'm doing this in my spare time. If you don't like this program don't use it.\n\n\n7. BUGS\n\nPlease read the BUGS file. There I describe a very annoying bug that exists\nin tail too. I haven't yet found anyway to fix this.\nIt you have a solution to that problem or if you have found another bug,\nplease send a mail to joakim@pjek.se\n\n\n8. THANKS\n\nThanks to:\nJoey Hess for multicolored lines patch.\nNic Bellamy for FreeBSD and OpenBSD compatability patch.\nEdward Betts for making debian packages.\nJustin Piszcz for extensive 64-bit testing."
