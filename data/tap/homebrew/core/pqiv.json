  "readme": "PQIV README\n===========\n\nAbout pqiv\n----------\n\npqiv is a powerful GTK 3 based command-line image viewer with a minimal UI. It\nis highly customizable, can be fully controlled from scripts, and has support\nfor various file formats including PDF, Postscript, video files and archives.\nIt is optimized to be quick and responsive.\n\nIt comes with support for animations, slideshows, transparency, VIM-like key\nbindings, automated loading of new images as they appear, external image\nfilters, marks, image preloading, and much more.\n\npqiv started as a Python rewrite of qiv avoiding imlib, but evolved into a much\nmore powerful tool. Today, pqiv stands for powerful quick image viewer.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n * Recursive loading from directories\n * Can watch files and directories for changes\n * Sorts images in natural order\n * Has a status bar showing information on the current image\n * Comes with transparency support\n * Can move/zoom/rotate/flip images\n * Can pipe images through external filters\n * Loads the next image in the background for quick response times\n * Caches zoomed images for smoother movement\n * Supports fade image transition animations\n * Supports various image and video formats through a rich set of backends\n * Comes with an interactive montage mode (a.k.a. \"image grid\")\n * Customizable key-bindings with support for VIM-like key sequences, action\n   cycling and binding multiple actions to a single key\n * Mark/unmark images and pipe the list of marked images to an external script\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nUsual stuff. `./configure && make && make install`. The configure script is\noptional if you only want gdk-pixbuf support and will auto-determine which\nbackends to build if invoked without parameters.\n\nYou can also use precompiled and packaged versions of pqiv. Note that the\ndistribution packages are usually somewhat out of date:\n\n * [Nightly builds for Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE and Fedora](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:phillipberndt/pqiv)\n   thanks to the OpenSUSE build service\n * [Alpine package](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/testing/x86/pqiv)\n * [Arch package](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/pqiv/)\n * [Debian package](https://packages.debian.org/en/sid/pqiv)\n * [FreeBSD port](https://www.freshports.org/graphics/pqiv/)\n * [Gentoo ebuild](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/media-gfx/pqiv)\n * [macOS brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pqiv)\n * [NixOS package](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/HEAD/pkgs/applications/graphics/pqiv/default.nix)\n * [OpenBSD port](http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/graphics/pqiv/)\n * [OpenSUSE package](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Factory/pqiv)\n * [Void linux](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/tree/master/srcpkgs/pqiv)\n\nIf you'd like to compile pqiv manually, you'll need\n\n * gtk+ 3.0 *or* gtk+ 2.6\n * gdk-pixbuf 2.2 (included in gtk+)\n * glib 2.32 (with gvfs for opening URLs)\n * cairo 1.6\n * Pango 1.10\n * gio 2.0\n * gdk 2.8\n\nand optionally also\n\n * ffmpeg / libav (for video support)\n * libarchive (for images in archives and cbX comic book files)\n * libspectre (any version, for ps/eps support)\n * libwebp (for WebP support)\n * MagickWand (any version, for additional image formats like psd)\n * poppler (any version, for pdf support)\n\nThe backends are per default linked statically into the code, so all backend\nrelated build-time dependencies are also run-time dependencies. If you need a\nshared version of the backends, for example for separate packaging of the\nbinaries or to make the run-time dependencies optional, use the\n`--backends-build=shared` configure option.\n\nFor macOS, have a look at the `pqiv.app` target of the Makefile, too.\n\npqiv can be linked statically, though GTK only supports static linking in\nGTK 2.x; in early versions of GTK 3.x it was fairly simple to still link\nstatically.\n\nWindows builds are supported and work in GTK 2.x, it is recommended to use\n[MXE](https://mxe.cc/) for cross-compiling.\n\nThanks\n------\n\nThis program uses Martin Pool's natsort algorithm\n<https://www.github.com/sourcefrog/natsort/>.\n\nContributors\n------------\n\nContributors to pqiv 2.x are:\n\n * J. Paul Reed\n * Chen Jonh L\n * Anton Älgmyr\n * Christian Garbs\n * Kanon Kubose\n * Wessel Dankers\n * @buzzingwires\n\nContributors to pqiv ≤ 1.0 were:\n\n * Alexander Sulfrian\n * Alexandros Diamantidis\n * Brandon\n * David Lindquist\n * Hanspeter Gysin\n * John Keeping\n * Nir Tzachar\n * Rene Saarsoo\n * Tinoucas\n * Yaakov\n\nKnown bugs\n----------\n\n* **The window is centered in between two monitors in old multi-head setups**:\n  This happens if you have the RandR extension enabled, but configured\n  incorrectly. GTK is programmed to first try RandR and use Xinerama only as\n  a fallback if that fails. (See `gdkscreen-x11.c`.) So if your video drivers\n  for some reason detect your multiple monitors as one big screen you can not\n  simply use fakexinerama to fix things. This might also apply to nvidia drivers\n  older than version 304. I believe that I can not fix this without breaking\n  functionality for other users or maintaining a blacklist, so you should\n  deactivate RandR completely until your driver is able to provide correct\n  information, or use a fake xrand (like\n  [mine](https://github.com/phillipberndt/fakexrandr), for example)\n\n* **Loading postscript files failes with `Error #12288; Unknown output format`**:\n  This issue happens if your poppler and spectre libraries are linked against\n  different versions of libcms. libcms and libcms2 will both be used, but\n  interfere with each other. Compile using `--backends-build=shared` to\n  circumvent this issue.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nBasic usage of pqiv is very straightforward, call\n\n    pqiv <files or directories>\n\nand then use space, backspace, `f` (for fullscreen), `q` (to quit), and `m` for\nthe montage overview to navigate through your images. To see all key bindings,\nsee the `DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS` section of the man-page, or run\n`pqiv --show-bindings`.\n\nFor some advanced uses of pqiv, take a look at these resouces:\n\n* [Play music while looking at specific images](https://github.com/phillipberndt/pqiv/issues/100#issuecomment-320651190)\n* <details><summary>Bind keys to cycle through panels of a 2x2 comic</summary>\n\n  Store this in your `.pqivrc`:\n  ```\n  # Bind c to act as if \"#c1\" was typed\n  c { send_keys(#c1); }\n  # If \"#c1\" is typed, shift the current image to it's north west corner, and\n  # rebind \"c\" to act as if \"#c2\" was typed\n  <numbersign>c1 { set_shift_align_corner(NW); bind_key(c { send_keys(#c2\\); }); }\n  # ..etc..\n  <numbersign>c2 { set_shift_align_corner(NE); bind_key(c { send_keys(#c3\\); }); }\n  <numbersign>c3 { set_shift_align_corner(SW); bind_key(c { send_keys(#c4\\); }); }\n  # The last binding closes the cycle by rebinding \"c\" to act as if \"#c1\" was typed\n  <numbersign>c4 { set_shift_align_corner(SE); bind_key(c { send_keys(#c1\\); }); }\n  ```\n\n  </details>\n\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\npqiv 2.13 (dev)\n * Fix `toggle_fullscreen(1/2)` behavior when
