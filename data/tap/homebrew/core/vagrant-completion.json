  "readme": "# Vagrant\n\n- Website: [https://www.vagrantup.com/](https://www.vagrantup.com/)\n- Source: [https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant)\n- HashiCorp Discuss: [https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/vagrant/24](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/vagrant/24)\n\nVagrant is a tool for building and distributing development environments.\n\nDevelopment environments managed by Vagrant can run on local virtualized\nplatforms such as VirtualBox or VMware, in the cloud via AWS or OpenStack,\nor in containers such as with Docker or raw LXC.\n\nVagrant provides the framework and configuration format to create and\nmanage complete portable development environments. These development\nenvironments can live on your computer or in the cloud, and are portable\nbetween Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nPackage dependencies: Vagrant requires `bsdtar` and `curl` to be available on\nyour system PATH to run successfully.\n\nFor the quick-start, we'll bring up a development machine on\n[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) because it is free and works\non all major platforms. Vagrant can, however, work with almost any\nsystem such as [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/), [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/), etc.\n\nFirst, make sure your development machine has\n[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)\ninstalled. After this,\n[download and install the appropriate Vagrant package for your OS](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).\n\nTo build your first virtual environment:\n\n    vagrant init hashicorp/bionic64\n    vagrant up\n\nNote: The above `vagrant up` command will also trigger Vagrant to download the\n`bionic64` box via the specified URL. Vagrant only does this if it detects that\nthe box doesn't already exist on your system.\n\n## Getting Started Guide\n\nTo learn how to build a fully functional development environment, follow the\n[getting started guide](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started).\n\n## Installing from Source\n\nIf you want the bleeding edge version of Vagrant, we try to keep main pretty stable\nand you're welcome to give it a shot. Please review the installation page [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/source).\n\n## Contributing to Vagrant\n\nPlease take time to read the [HashiCorp Community Guidelines](https://www.hashicorp.com/community-guidelines) and the [Vagrant Contributing Guide](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nThen you're good to go!"
