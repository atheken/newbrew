You should read\nthe rest of this file for information on what ivtools is and the\nINSTALL file for instructions on how to build it.\n\nThe overall copyright and permission notice for ivtools can be found\nin the COPYRIGHT file in this directory.  It is similar to the X11\ncopyright, otherwise known as non-copylefted freeware.  \n\n* What is ivtools?:\n\nOnline documentation (including an FAQ) is available for ivtools at:\n\n\thttp://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/doc/\n\nivtools is a layered collection of application frameworks for building\ncustom drawing editors and spatial data servers.  It incorporates a\nbackward compatible copy of the original InterViews and Unidraw class\nlibraries and sample programs (from 3.2a.tar.Z), augmented with new\nclass libraries and sample programs for a wide variety of generic\nspatial data applications.\n\nivtools comprises four sets of interrelated capabilities useful to\napplication programmers.  The first set is the libraries and example\nprograms borrowed whole from InterViews 3.1.  The second set is for\nreusing and extending the light-weight glyph objects of InterViews 3.1\nwhich embody a lot of the capability of TeX.  The third set reuses and\nextends the Unidraw library (Unidraw is a major portion of the overall\nInterViews 3.1 release that provides an application framework for\ncustom drawing editors).  The fourth set adds a command interpreter\nand server mechanism to ivtools, and demonstrates these capabilities\nwith text, glyph, and graphic front-ends.  To get more of an overview\nof these layers you can read:\n\n    http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/ivtools-layers.html.\n\nThese are the libraries and example programs borrowed straight from\nInterViews 3.1:\n\n\tIV\t\tlibrary of InterView 3.1, InterViews 2.6, Dispatch,\n\t\t\tOS, and TIFF objects\n\tdclock\t\tdigital clock with fading digits\n\ticlass\t\tC++ class browser\n\tidemo\t\tglyph demo \n\nThese are the libraries and example programs that make up the glyph\npart of ivtools (programs in the glyphs directory):\n\n\tIVGlyph\t\tlibrary of Glyph derived classes\n\n\tbdvtable        bounded-value editing \n\tformdemo\tvalue-editing \n\tgclock\t\tglyph-based clock\n\tmeter           sliding meter\n\tradiogroup      radio-buttons\n\tscrollable\t2d scrollable glyph\n\tscrollfield\t2d scrollable field-editor\n\tstrchooser\tstring chooser \n\ttimestamp\teditable time glyph\n\nPlus a generally useful text display and editing program:\n\n\tivtext     emacs-like text editor \n\nAlso all the glyph example programs from InterViews 3.1 have been\nadded in an examples3.1 directory under the glyphs directory.\n\nThese are the libraries and example programs that make up the Unidraw\npart of ivtools:\n\n\tUnidraw\t\tcopy of Unidraw library from InterViews 3.1\n\tUniIdraw        librarification of 3.1 idraw \n\tOverlayUnidraw  extended Unidraw/idraw framework\n\tTopoFace\tspatial network library (nodes, edges, faces)\n\tGraphUnidraw    graph browser/editor library\n\tFrameUnidraw    multi-frame display mechanism\n\n\tidraw\t\tidraw built on UniIdraw library\n\tdrawtool        extended version of idraw built on OverlayUnidraw\n\tgraphdraw       graph browser/editor integrated with drawtool\n\tflipbook        flipbook multi-frame editor based on drawtool\n\nThese are the libraries that make up the command interpreter part of\nivtools:\n\n\tComUtil\t\tcommand interpreter utility functions\n\tAttribute\tattribute property list mechanism\n\tAttrGlyph\tglyphs for Attribute library\n\tComTerp\t\tcommand interpreter objects\n\tComGlyph\tglyphs for ComTerp library\t\n\tComUnidraw      drawing editor with command interpreter\n\tDrawServ        drawing server framework with support\n\t\t\tfor graphs and frames.\n\n\tcomtest\t\ttest program\n\tcomterp \tsample command interpreter \n\tglyphterp\tcommand interpreter user interface\n\tcomdraw\t\tdrawtool with command interpreter\n\tdrawserv        comdraw with both graphs and frames.\n\nNote: GraphUnidraw/graphdraw and FrameUnidraw/flipbook have been\nrearranged within the ivtools source tree to take advantage of the\nComUnidraw framework layer, so they really could be listed in both of\nthe previous sections.\n\nThere is also a Time library with Date and Time classes borrowed from\nthe NIH's class library, and an example program, ivxt, that shows how\nan Xt widget can be wrapped around an InterViews application.\nFinally, there is a collection of utilities (utils) and shell scripts\n(scripts) that augment the drawing editors of ivtools with minor\ncapabilities.  See the relevant directories and files for further\ninformation.\n\t\nA series of makefile targets support the checkin of sources to\ncvs/rcs, and their subsequent update and modification.  This requires\na copy of cvs available from the Free Software Foundation and\nivmkcm-0.7.2 available through http://www.ivtools.org/ivmkcm/\n\n* More ivtools details\n\nivtools is known to build with many versions of gcc (up to gcc-4.3)\nand on a variety of Unix'es: SunOS 4.1 (MIT's X11R5), Solaris 2.6\n(X11R6), Irix 5.2 (SGI's X11R5), Linux 1.2 (Slackware 3.0, XFree86\n3.1), Linux 2.* (RedHat 4.0 thru 7.0, Debian 2.* and 3.*), NetBSD,\nFreeBSD, and Darwin (Mac OS X).  There are contributed configs that\nare out of date for HPUX and Dec Alpha (though the HPUX contrib might\nalmost have it right). It has been built on Windows NT 4.0 using\nCygwin from Cygnus Solutions (see README.cygwin).  You can find links\nto available binaries on the ivtools web page (http://www.ivtools.org)\nand ivtools download page\n(http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/download.html)\n\nIf you have a question about this software, desire to add code, found\na bug, want to request a feature, or wonder how to get further\nassistance, please send e-mail to the general purpose ivtools mailing\nlist, ivtools-user@lists.sourceforge.net.  To subcribe to the mailing\nlist, visit\nhttp://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/ivtools-user.  Other\nivtools related mailing lists can be found at:\n\n\thttp://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/mailinglists.html\n\nRead about finding and generating all this from inline documentation\nbelow.  A copy of the (older) ivtools html documentation will be available for\ndownload as well:\n\n\thttp://downloads.sourceforge.net/ivtools/ivtools-doc-1.2.tgz\n\nA SourceForge project page for ivtools can be found at:\n\n\thttp://sourceforge.net/project/ivtools\n\nRead about other vector graphic free software at:\n\n\thttp://sourceforge.net/foundry/vectorgraphics\n\n* Finding and Generating Inline Documentation\n\nExtensive documentation is embedded within the ivtools source tree,\nincluding most all of the documentation originally available for\nInterViews 3.1 and Unidraw.  You can find all of it pre-extracted\nhere:\n\n        http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/doc/\n\nHere is a list of documentation:\n\n\t- README/man pages for executable programs\n\n\tWithin most directories that contain an executable program\n\t(a main.c) you'll find a README that explains something\n\tabout the program, how to use it, what it does, what\n\targuments it takes.  In the case of the drawing editors\n\tand command interpreters this README has been further\n\tprocessed into a man page, which can be found in its\n\tuninstalled state in the src/man/man1 directory or wherever \n\tyou elect to install them.\n\n\t- HTML class documentation\n\n\tMany of the C++ class libraries of ivtools are documented \n\tusing comments in the header files (the .h files) that can\n\tbe extracted using PERCEPS, a Perl documentation generator for\n\tC++ (http://starship.python.net/crew/tbryan/PERCEPS/).\n\n\tSee src/html/README for instructions on auto-generating these\n\tweb pages yourself, or see the result on-line at:\n\n\t\thttp://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/doc/classes/\n\n\t- InterViews 3.1 and Unidraw man pages\n\n\tAll the original man pages from InterViews 3.1 and Unidraw have\n\tbeen preserved, and can be found in src/man/man3, or where ever\n\tyou elect to install them.  They also can be browsed online at:\n\n\t\thttp://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/doc/man3.1/\n\n\t- InterViews 3.1 reference manual \n\n\tThe original reference manual for InterViews 3.1 can be found in\n\tPostScript form at src/man/refman3.1/refman.PS.  It is also\n\tfound in page-indexable online form at:\n\n\t\thttp://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/doc/refman3.1/\n\n\n* Building on top of ivtools\n\nCopied from the ivtools FAQ: \n\n\thttp://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/faq.html#standalonedevel\n\nQ: How do I set up a stand-alone program or source tree on top of ivtools\nfor development purposes?\n\nA: If you are writing a stand-alone program that will exist in a\nsingle directory, simply copy an appropriate Imakefile and main.c from\na InterViews or ivtools example program directory, modify accordingly,\nthen use \"ivmkmf -a\" to generate the Makefile. Make sure you are using\na fresh ivmkmf that corresponds to your installation of ivtools. An\nexample of this is the comtop sample program, a stand-alone program\nseparate from ivtools that builds on top of the comterp command\ninterpreter mechanism.  \n\n** comtop.tgz is now part of the ivtools distribution **\n\nIf you are setting up an entire source tree with both class libraries\nand executable programs, you will want to get started by replicating\nan equivalent source tree (i.e. vhclmaps) and change or rename all\ndirectories or files as appropriate. \n\n** read more on vhclmaps at http://www.ivtools.org/vhclmaps/ **\n\n\n* Acknowledgements:\n\nRoster of ivtools programmers:\n\n\tScott Johnston\n\tJorge Gautier\n\tBrian Hogencamp\n\tRick Kissh\n\tEric Kahler\n\nInterViews 3.1 programmers that we know of:\n\n\tMark Linton\n\tJohn Vlissides\n\tPaul Calder\n\tJohn Interrante\n\tScott Stanton\n\tSteven Tang\n\nivtools can be built to leverage a variety of separate third-party\nlibraries:\n\n\t* clippoly from Klamer Schutte for polygon intersection\n\t(licensed under the LGPL)\n\n\t* ACE from Doug Schmidt for middleware networking frameworks\n\t(licensed similar to X Windows)\n\nivtools detects and uses at runtime a variety of third-party executables:\n\n\t* qhull from the University of Minnesota Geometry Center\n\n\t* pstoedit from Wolfgang Glunz\n\n\t* ghostscript from L. Peter Deutsch and Aladdin Systems\n\n\t* djpeg from the JPEG group\n\n\t* giftopnm from Jef Poskanzer's pbmplus toolkit\n\t(a copy of anytopnm from the same toolkit is incorporated into\n\tthe scripts directory)\n\nOverlayUnidraw incorporates Version 3.1 of a \"C++ Vector and Matrix\nAlgebra routnes\" (algebra3.h) from Jean-Francois Doue.\n\t\nHPUX (HP-800) config contributed by Neal Becker.  ALPHA config\ncontributed by Bruno Delfosse at Thomson CSF.  A lot of feedback on\nSolaris 2.6 building from M. Rasit Eskicioglu at the University of\nAlberta.
