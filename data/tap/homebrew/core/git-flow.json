  "readme": "git-flow\n========\n\nA collection of Git extensions to provide high-level repository operations\nfor Vincent Driessen's [branching model](http://nvie.com/git-model \"original\nblog post\").\n\n\nGetting started\n---------------\nFor the best introduction to get started with `git flow`, please read Jeff\nKreeftmeijer's blog post:\n\n[http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/)\n\nOr have a look at one of these screen casts:\n\n* [How to use a scalable Git branching model called git-flow](http://buildamodule.com/video/change-management-and-version-control-deploying-releases-features-and-fixes-with-git-how-to-use-a-scalable-git-branching-model-called-gitflow) (by Build a Module)\n* [A short introduction to git-flow](http://vimeo.com/16018419) (by Mark Derricutt)\n* [On the path with git-flow](http://codesherpas.com/screencasts/on_the_path_gitflow.mov) (by Dave Bock)\n\n\nInstalling git-flow\n-------------------\nSee the Wiki for up-to-date [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation).\n\n\nIntegration with your shell\n---------------------------\nFor those who use the [Bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) or\n[ZSH](http://www.zsh.org) shell, please check out the excellent work on the\n[git-flow-completion](http://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion) project\nby [bobthecow](http://github.com/bobthecow). It offers tab-completion for all\ngit-flow subcommands and branch names.\n\n\nFAQ\n---\nSee the [FAQ](http://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/FAQ) section of the project\nWiki.\n\n\nPlease help out\n---------------\nThis project is still under development. Feedback and suggestions are very\nwelcome and I encourage you to use the [Issues\nlist](http://github.com/nvie/gitflow/issues) on Github to provide that\nfeedback.\n\nFeel free to fork this repo and to commit your additions. For a list of all\ncontributors, please see the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) file.\n\nAny questions, tips, or general discussion can be posted to our Google group:\n[http://groups.google.com/group/gitflow-users](http://groups.google.com/group/gitflow-users)\n\nContributing\n------------\nFork the repository.  Then, run:\n\n    git clone --recursive git@github.com:<username>/gitflow.git\n    cd gitflow\n    git branch master origin/master\n    git flow init -d\n    git flow feature start <your feature>\n\nThen, do work and commit your changes.  **Hint**: ``export PATH=`pwd`:$PATH``\nfrom within the gitflow directory makes sure you're using the version of\ngitflow you're currently developing.\n\n    git flow feature publish <your feature>\n\nWhen done, open a pull request to your feature branch.\n\nLicense terms\n-------------\ngit-flow is published under the liberal terms of the BSD License, see the\n[LICENSE](LICENSE) file. Although the BSD License does not require you to share\nany modifications you make to the source code, you are very much encouraged and\ninvited to contribute back your modifications to the community, preferably\nin a Github fork, of course.\n\n\n### Initialization\n\nTo initialize a new repo with the basic branch structure, use:\n  \n\t\tgit flow init [-d]\n  \nThis will then interactively prompt you with some questions on which branches\nyou would like to use as development and production branches, and how you\nwould like your prefixes be named. You may simply press Return on any of\nthose questions to accept the (sane) default suggestions.\n\nThe ``-d`` flag will accept all defaults.\n\n\n### Creating feature/release/hotfix/support branches\n\n* To list/start/finish feature branches, use:\n  \n  \t\tgit flow feature\n  \t\tgit flow feature start <name> [<base>]\n  \t\tgit flow feature finish <name>\n  \n  For feature branches, the `<base>` arg must be a commit on `develop`.\n\n* To push/pull a feature branch to the remote repository, use:\n\n  \t\tgit flow feature publish <name>\n\t\t  git flow feature pull <remote> <name>\n\n* To list/start/finish release branches, use:\n  \n  \t\tgit flow release\n  \t\tgit flow release start <release> [<base>]\n  \t\tgit flow release finish <release>\n  \n  For release branches, the `<base>` arg must be a commit on `develop`.\n  \n* To list/start/finish hotfix branches, use:\n  \n  \t\tgit flow hotfix\n  \t\tgit flow hotfix start <release> [<base>]\n  \t\tgit flow hotfix finish <release>\n  \n  For hotfix branches, the `<base>` arg must be a commit on `master`.\n\n* To list/start support branches, use:\n  \n  \t\tgit flow support\n  \t\tgit flow support start <release> <base>\n  \n  For support branches, the `<base>` arg must be a commit on `master`.\n\n\nShowing your appreciation\n=========================\nA few people already requested it, so now it's here: a Flattr button.\n\nOf course, the best way to show your appreciation for the original\n[blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) or the git-flow tool itself remains\ncontributing to the community.  If you'd like to show your appreciation in\nanother way, however, consider Flattr'ing me:\n\n[![Flattr this][2]][1]\n\n[1]: http://flattr.com/thing/53771/git-flow\n[2]: http://api.flattr.com/button/button-static-50x60.png"
