  "readme": "# Prototool\n\n[![MIT License][mit-img]][mit] [![GitHub Release][release-img]][release] [![Build Status][ci-img]][ci] [![Coverage Status][cov-img]][cov] [![Docker Image][docker-img]][docker] [![Homebrew Package][homebrew-img]][homebrew] [![AUR Package][aur-img]][aur]\n\n**Update:  We recommend checking out [Buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf), which is under active development.  There are a ton of docs for getting started, including for [migration from Prototool](https://buf.build/docs/migration-prototool).**\n\n\n[Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) is one of the best interface description\nlanguages out there - it's widely adopted, and after over 15 years of use, it's practically\nbulletproof. However, working with Protobuf and maintaining consistency across your Protobuf files\ncan be a pain - `protoc`, while being a tool that has stood the test of time, is non-trivial to\nuse, and the Protobuf community has not developed common standards with regards to stub generation.\nPrototool aims to solve this by making working with Protobuf much simpler.\n\nPrototool lets you:\n\n- Handle installation of `protoc` and the import of all of the Well-Known Types behind the scenes\n  in a platform-independent manner.\n- Standardize building of your Protobuf files with a common [configuration](#configuration).\n- [Lint](#prototool-lint) your Protobuf files with common linting rules according to\n  [Google' Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style),\n  [Uber's V1 Style Guide](../etc/style/uber1/uber1.proto),\n  [Uber's V2 Style Guide](../style/README.md), or your own set of configured lint rules.\n- [Format](#prototool-format) your Protobuf files in a consistent manner.\n- [Create](#prototool-create) Protobuf files from a template that passes lint, taking care of\n  package naming for you.\n- [Generate](#prototool-generate) stubs using any plugin based on a simple configuration file,\n  including handling imports of all the Well-Known Types.\n- Call [gRPC](#prototool-grpc) endpoints with ease, taking care of the JSON to binary\n  conversion for you.\n- Check for [breaking changes](#prototool-break-check) on a per-package basis, verifying that your\n  API never breaks.\n- Output errors and lint failures in a common `file:line:column:message` format, making integration\n  with editors possible, [Vim integration](#vim-integration) is provided out of the box.\n\nPrototool accomplishes this by downloading and calling `protoc` on the fly for you, handing error\nmessages from `protoc` and your plugins, and using the generated `FileDescriptorSets` for internal\nfunctionality, as well as wrapping a few great external libraries already in the Protobuf\necosystem. Compiling, linting and formatting commands run in around 3/100ths of second for a single\nProtobuf file, or under a second for a larger number (500+) of Protobuf files.\n\n## Table Of Contents\n\n  * [Installation](#installation)\n  * [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n  * [Full Example](#full-example)\n  * [Configuration](#configuration)\n  * [File Discovery](#file-discovery)\n  * [Command Overview](#command-overview)\n    * [prototool config init](#prototool-config-init)\n    * [prototool compile](#prototool-compile)\n    * [prototool generate](#prototool-generate)\n    * [prototool lint](#prototool-lint)\n    * [prototool format](#prototool-format)\n    * [prototool create](#prototool-create)\n    * [prototool files](#prototool-files)\n    * [prototool break check](#prototool-break-check)\n    * [prototool descriptor-set](#prototool-descriptor-set)\n    * [prototool grpc](#prototool-grpc)\n  * [Tips and Tricks](#tips-and-tricks)\n  * [Vim Integration](#vim-integration)\n  * [Stability](#stability)\n  * [Development](#development)\n  * [FAQ](#faq)\n  * [Special Thanks](#special-thanks)\n\n## Installation\n\nPrototool can be installed on Mac OS X or Linux through a variety of methods.\n\n*See [install.md](install.md) for full instructions.*\n\n## Quick Start\n\nWe'll start with a general overview of the commands. There are more commands, and we will get into]\nusage below, but this shows the basic functionality.\n\n```bash\nprototool help\nprototool lint idl/uber # search for all .proto files recursively, obeying exclude_paths in prototool.yaml or prototool.json files\nprototool lint # same as \"prototool lint .\", by default the current directory is used in directory mode\nprototool create foo.proto # create the file foo.proto from a template that passes lint\nprototool files idl/uber # list the files that will be used after applying exclude_paths from corresponding prototool.yaml or prototool.json files\nprototool lint --list-linters # list all current lint rules being used\nprototool lint --list-all-lint-groups # list all available lint groups, currently \"google\" and \"uber\"\nprototool compile idl/uber # make sure all .proto files in idl/uber compile, but do not generate stubs\nprototool generate idl/uber # generate stubs, see the generation directives in the config file example\nprototool grpc idl/uber --address 0.0.0.0:8080 --method foo.ExcitedService/Exclamation --data '{\"value\":\"hello\"}' # call the foo.ExcitedService method Exclamation with the given data on 0.0.0.0:8080\nprototool descriptor-set --include-imports idl/uber # generate a FileDescriptorSet for all files under idl/uber, outputting to stdout, a given file, or a temporary file\nprototool break check idl/uber --git-branch master # check for breaking changes as compared to the Protobuf definitions in idl/uber on the master branch\n```\n\n## Full Example\n\nSee the [example](../example) directory.\n\nThe make command `make example` runs prototool while installing the necessary plugins.\n\n## Configuration\n\nPrototool operates using a config file named either `prototool.yaml` or `prototool.json`. Only one\nof `prototool.yaml` or `prototool.json` can exist in a given directory. For non-trivial use, you\nshould have a config file checked in to at least the root of your repository. It is important\nbecause the directory of an associated config file is passed to `protoc` as an include directory\nwith `-I`, so this is the logical location your Protobuf file imports should start from.\n\nRecommended base config file:\n\n```yaml\nprotoc:\n  version: 3.11.0\nlint:\n  group: uber2\n```\n\n*See [protoc.md](protoc.md) for how Prototool handles working with `protoc`.*\n\nThe command `prototool config init` will generate a config file in the current directory with the\ncurrently recommended options set.\n\nWhen specifying a directory or set of files for Prototool to operate on, Prototool will search for\nconfig files for each directory starting at the given path, and going up a directory until hitting\nroot. If no config file is found, Prototool will use default values and operate as if there was a\nconfig file in the current directory, including the current directory with `-I` to `protoc`.\n\nIf multiple `prototool.yaml` or `prototool.json` files are found that match the input directory or\nfiles, an error will be returned.\n\nSee [etc/config/example/prototool.yaml](../etc/config/example/prototool.yaml) all available\noptions.\n\n## File Discovery\n\nIn most Prototool commands, you will see help along the following lines:\n\n```bash\n$ prototool help lint\nLint proto files and compile with protoc to check for failures.\n\nUsage:\n  prototool lint [dirOrFile] [flags]\n```\n\n`dirOrFile` can take two forms:\n\n- You can specify exactly one directory. If this is done, Prototool goes up until it finds a\n  `prototool.yaml` or `prototool.json` file (or uses the current directory if none is found), and\n  then uses this config for all `.proto` files under the given directory recursively, except for\n  files in the `excludes` lists in `prototool.yaml` or `prototool.json` files.\n- You can specify exactly one file. This has the effect as if you specified the directory of this\n  file (using the logic above), but errors are only printed for that file. This is useful for\n  e.g. Vim integration.\n- You can specify nothing. This has the effect as if you specified the current directory as the\n  directory.\n\nThe idea with \"directory builds\" is that you often need more than just one file to do a `protoc`\ncall, for example if you have types in other files in the same package that are not referenced by\ntheir fully-qualified name, and/or if you need to know what directories to specify with `-I` to\n`protoc` (by default, the directory of the `prototool.yaml` or `prototool.json` file is used).\n\n## Command Overview\n\nLet's go over some of the basic commands.\n\n##### `prototool config init`\n\nCreate a `prototool.yaml` file in the current directory with the currently recommended options set.\n\nPass the `--document` flag to generate a `prototool.yaml` file with all other options documented\nand commented out.\n\nPass the `--uncomment` flag to generate `prototool.yaml` file with all options documented but\nuncommented.\n\nSee [etc/config/example/prototool.yaml](../etc/config/example/prototool.yaml) for the config file\nthat `prototool config init --uncomment` generates.\n\n##### `prototool compile`\n\nCompile your Protobuf files, but do not generate stubs. This has the effect of calling `protoc`\nwith `-o /dev/null`.\n\nPass the `--dry-run` flag to see the `protoc` commands that Prototool runs behind the scenes.\n\n##### `prototool generate`\n\nCompile your Protobuf files and generate stubs according to the rules in your `prototool.yaml` or\n`prototool.json` file.\n\nSee [etc/config/example/prototool.yaml](../etc/config/example/prototool.yaml) for all available\noptions. There are special options available for Golang plugins, and plugins that output a single\nfile instead of a set of files. Specifically, you can output a single JAR for the built-in `protoc`\n`java` plugin, and you can output a file with the serialized `FileDescriptorSet` using the built-in\n`protoc` `descriptor_set` plugin, optionally also calling `--include_imports` and/or\n`--include_source_info`.\n\nPass the `--dry-run` flag to see the `protoc` commands that Prototool runs behind the scenes.\n\nSee [example/proto/prototool.yaml](../example/proto/prototool.yaml) for a full example.\n\n##### `prototool lint`\n\nLint rules can be set using the configuration file. See the configuration at\n[etc/config/example/prototool.yaml](../etc/config/example/prototool.yaml) for all available\noptions. There are three pre-configured groups of rules, the setting of which is integral to the\n`prototool lint`, `prototool create`, and `prototool format` commands:\n\n- `uber2`: This lint group follows the [V2 Uber Style Guide](../style/README.md), and makes some\n  modifications to more closely follow the Google Cloud APIs file structure, as well as adding even\n  more rules to enforce more consistent development patterns. This is the lint group we recommend\n  using.\n- `uber1`: This lint group follows the [V1 Uber Style Guide](../etc/style/uber1/uber1.proto). For\n  backwards compatibility reasons, this is the default lint group, however we recommend using the\n  `uber2` lint group.\n- `google`: This lint group follows the\n  [Google Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style). This is a small\n  group of rules meant to enforce basic naming. The style guide is copied to\n  [etc/style/google/google.proto](../etc/style/google/google.proto).\n\nThe flag `--generate-ignores` will help with migrating to a given lint group by generating\nthe configuration to ignore existing lint failures on a per-file basis.\n\n*See [lint.md](lint.md) for full instructions.*\n\n##### `prototool format`\n\nFormat a Protobuf file and print the formatted file to stdout. There are flags to perform different\nactions:\n\n- `-d` Write a diff instead.\n- `-f` Fix the file according to the Style Guide. This will have different behavior if the `uber2`\n  lint group is set.\n- `-l` Write a lint error in the form file:line:column:message if a file is unformatted.\n- `-w` Overwrite the existing file instead.\n\n##### `prototool create`\n\nCreate Protobuf files from a template. With the provided Vim integration, this will automatically\ncreate new files that pass lint when a new file is opened.\n\n*See [create.md](create.md) for full instructions.*\n\n##### `prototool files`\n\nPrint the list of all files that will be used given the input `dirOrFile`. Useful for debugging.\n\n##### `prototool break check`\n\nProtobuf is a great way to represent your APIs and generate stubs in each language you develop\nwith. As such, Protobuf APIs should be stable so as not to break consumers across repositories.\nEven in a monorepo context, making sure that your Protobuf APIs do not introduce breaking\nchanges is important so that different deployed versions of your services do not have\nwire incompatibilities.\n\nPrototool exposes a breaking change detector through the `prototool break check` command. This will\ncheck your current Protobuf definitions against a past version of your Protobuf definitions to see\nif there are any source or wire incompatible changes. Some notes on this command:\n\n- The breaking change detection operates on a **per-package** basis, not per-file - definitions\n  can be moved between files within the same Protobuf package without being considered breaking.\n- The breaking change detector can either check against a given git branch or tag, or it can check\n  against a previous state saved with the `prototool break descriptor-set` command.\n- The breaking change detector understands the concept of **beta vs. stable packages**, discussed\n  in the [V2 Style Guide](../style/README.md#package-versioning). By default, the breaking change\n  detector will not check beta packages for breaking changes, and will not allow stable packages to\n  depend on beta packages, however both of these options are configurable in your `prototool.yaml`\n  file.\n\n*See [breaking.md](breaking.md) for full instructions.*\n\n##### `prototool descriptor-set`\n\nProduce a serialized `FileDescriptorSet` for all Protobuf definitions. By default, the serialized\n`FileDescriptorSet` is printed to stdout. There are a few options:\n\n- `--include-imports, --include-source-info` are analagous to `protoc`'s `--include_imports,\n  --include_source_info` flags.\n- `--json` outputs the FileDescriptorSet as JSON instead of binary.\n- `-o` writes the `FileDescriptorSet` to the given output file path.\n- `--tmp` writes the `FileDescriptorset` to a temporary file and prints the file path.\n\nThe outputted `FileDescriptorSet` is a merge of all produced `FileDescriptorSets` for each\nProtobuf package compiled.\n\nThis command is useful in a few situations.\n\nOne such situation is with external gRPC tools such as [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl)\nor [ghz](https://ghz.sh). Both tools take a path to a serialized `FileDescriptorSet` for use to\nfigure out the request/response structure of RPCs when the gRPC reflection service is not available.\n`prototool descriptor-set` can be used to generate these `FileDescriptorSet`s on the fly.\n\n```bash\ngrpcurl -protoset $(prototool descriptor-set --include-imports --tmp) ...\nghz -protoset $(prototool descriptor-set --include-imports --tmp) ...\n```\n\nYou can also just save the file once and not re-compile each time.\n\n```bash\nprototool descriptor-set --include-imports -o descriptor_set.bin\ngrpcurl -protoset descriptor_set.bin ...\nghz -protoset descriptor_set.bin ...\n```\n\nAnother situation is to use `jq` to make arbitrary queries on your Protobuf definitions.\n\nFor example, if your Protobuf definitions are in `path/to/proto`, the following will print\nall message names.\n\n```bash\nprototool descriptor-set path/to/proto --json | \\\n  jq '.file[] | select(.messageType != null) | .messageType[] | .name' | \\\n  sort | uniq\n```\n\n##### `prototool grpc`\n\nCall a gRPC endpoint using a JSON input. What this does behind the scenes:\n\n- Compiles your Protobuf files with `protoc`, generating a `FileDescriptorSet`.\n- Uses the `FileDescriptorSet` to figure out the request and response type for the endpoint, and to\n  convert the JSON input to binary.\n- Calls the gRPC endpoint.\n- Uses the `FileDescriptorSet` to convert the resulting binary back to JSON, and prints it out for\n  you.\n\n*See [grpc.md](grpc.md) for full instructions.*\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n\nPrototool is meant to help enforce a consistent development style for Protobuf, and as such you\nshould follow some basic rules:\n\n- Have all your imports start from the directory your `prototool.yaml` or `prototool.json` file is\n  in. While there is a configuration option `protoc.includes` to denote extra include directories,\n  this is not recommended.\n- Have all Protobuf files in the same directory use the same `package`.\n- Do not use long-form `go_package` values, ie use `foopb`, not `github.com/bar/baz/foo;foopb`.\n  This helps `prototool generate` do the best job.\n\n## Vim Integration\n\nThis repository is a self-contained plugin for use with the\n[ALE Lint Engine](https://github.com/w0rp/ale). The Vim integration will currently compile, provide\nlint errors, do generation of your stubs, and format your files on save. It will also optionally\ncreate new files from a template when opened.\n\n*See [vim.md](vim.md) for full instructions.*\n\n## Stability\n\nPrototool is generally available, and conforms to [SemVer](https://semver.org), so Prototool will\nnot have any breaking changes on a given major version, with some exceptions:\n\n- Commands under the `x` top-level command are experimental, and may change or be deleted between\n  minor versions of Prototool. We expect such commands to be promoted to stable within a few minor\n  releases, however development is still in-progress.\n- The output of the formatter may change between minor versions. This has not happened yet, but we\n  may change the format in the future to reflect things such as max line lengths.\n- The breaking change detector's output format currently does not output filename, line, or column.\n  This is an expected upgrade in the future, so the output will likely change. This is viewed as\n  purely an upgrade, so until this is done, do not parse `prototool break check` output in scripts.\n- The breaking change detector may have additional checks added between minor versions, and\n  therefore a change that might not have been breaking previously might become a breaking change.\n  This may become stable in the near future, and at this time we'll denote that no more checks\n  will be added.\n\n## Development\n\nSee [development.md](development.md) for concerns related to Prototool development.\n\nSee [maintenance.md](maintenance.md) for maintenance-related tasks.\n\n## FAQ\n\nSee [faq.md](faq.md) for answers to frequently asked questions.\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nPrototool uses some external libraries that deserve special mention and thanks for their\ncontribution to Prototool's functionality:\n\n- [github.com/emicklei/proto](https://github.com/emicklei/proto) - The Golang Protobuf parsing\n  library that started it all, and is still used for the linting and formatting functionality. We\n  can't thank Ernest Micklei enough for his help and putting up with all the\n  [filed issues](https://github.com/emicklei/proto/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).\n- [github.com/jhump/protoreflect](https://github.com/jhump/protoreflect) - Used for the JSON to\n  binary and back conversion. Josh Humphries is an amazing developer, thank you so much.\n- [github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) - Still used for the\n  gRPC functionality. Again a thank you to Josh Humphries and the team over at FullStory for their\n  work.\n\n[mit-img]: http://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg\n[mit]: https://github.com/uber/prototool/blob/master/LICENSE\n\n[release-img]: https://img.shields.io/github/release/uber/prototool/all.svg\n[release]: https://github.com/uber/prototool/releases\n\n[ci-img]: https://img.shields.io/buildkite/5faf32c23003786e641b9140ee98175b81c8bae973ae188415/dev.svg\n[ci]: https://buildkite.com/uberopensource/prototool\n\n[cov-img]: https://codecov.io/gh/uber/prototool/branch/dev/graph/badge.svg\n[cov]: https://codecov.io/gh/uber/prototool/branch/dev\n\n[docker-img]: https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/uber/prototool.svg\n[docker]: https://hub.docker.com/r/uber/prototool\n\n[homebrew-img]: https://img.shields.io/homebrew/v/prototool.svg\n[homebrew]: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/prototool\n\n[aur-img]: https://img.shields.io/aur/version/prototool-bin.svg\n[aur]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/prototool-bin"
