The _active_ Node.js version is installed in subdirectories `bin`, `include`, `lib`, and `share`.\n\nTo avoid requiring `sudo` for `n` and `npm` global installs, it is suggested you either install to your home directory using `N_PREFIX`, or take ownership of the system directories:\n\n    # make cache folder (if missing) and take ownership\n    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/n\n    sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/n\n    # make sure the required folders exist (safe to execute even if they already exist)\n    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include /usr/local/share\n    # take ownership of Node.js install destination folders\n    sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include /usr/local/share\n\n-----\n\nIf `npm` is not yet available, one way to bootstrap an install is to download and run `n` directly. To install the `lts` version of Node.js:\n\n    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tj/n/master/bin/n | bash -s lts\n    # If you want n installed, you can use npm now.\n    npm install -g n\n\nAlternatively, you can clone this repo and\n\n    make install\n\nto install `n` to `bin/n` of the directory specified in the environment variable `$PREFIX`, which defaults to `/usr/local` (note that you will likely need to use `sudo`). To install `n` in a custom location (such as `$CUSTOM_LOCATION/bin/n`), run `PREFIX=$CUSTOM_LOCATION make install`.\n\n### Third Party Installers\n\nOn macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) you can install the [n formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/n.rb).\n\n    brew install n\n\nOr on macOS with [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) you can install the [n port](https://ports.macports.org/port/n/summary):\n\n    port install n\n\nOn Linux and macOS, [n-install](https://github.com/mklement0/n-install) allows installation directly from GitHub; for instance:\n\n    curl -L https://bit.ly/n-install | bash\n\nn-install sets both `PREFIX` and `N_PREFIX` to `$HOME/n`, installs `n` to `$HOME/n/bin`, modifies the initialization files of supported shells to export `N_PREFIX` and add `$HOME/n/bin` to the `PATH`, and installs the latest LTS Node.js version.\n\nAs a result, both `n` itself and all Node.js versions it manages are hosted inside a single, optionally configurable directory, which you can later remove with the included `n-uninstall` script. `n-update` updates `n` itself to the latest version. See the [n-install repo](https://github.com/mklement0/n-install) for more details.\n\n## Installing Node.js Versions\n\nSimply execute `n <version>` to download and install a version of Node.js. If `<version>` has already been downloaded, `n` will install from its cache.\n\n    n 10.16.0\n    n lts\n\nExecute `n` on its own to view your downloaded versions, and install the selected version.\n\n    $ n\n\n      node/4.9.1\n    ο node/8.11.3\n      node/10.15.0\n\n    Use up/down arrow keys to select a version, return key to install, d to delete, q to quit\n\n(You can also use <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>k</kbd> to select next or previous version instead of using arrows, or <kbd>ctrl+n</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl+p</kbd>.)\n\nIf the active node version does not change after install, try opening a new shell in case seeing a stale version.\n\n## Specifying Node.js Versions\n\nThere are a variety of ways of specifying the target Node.js version for `n` commands. Most commands use the latest matching version, and  `n ls-remote` lists multiple matching versions.\n\nNumeric version numbers can be complete or incomplete, with an optional leading `v`.\n\n- `4.9.1`\n- `8`: 8.x.y versions\n- `v6.1`: 6.1.x versions\n\nThere are labels for two especially useful versions:\n\n- `lts`: newest Long Term Support official release\n- `latest`, `current`: newest official release\n  \nThere is an `auto` label to read the target version from a file in the current directory, or any parent directory. `n` looks for in order:\n\n- `.n-node-version`: version on single line. Custom to `n`.\n- `.node-version`: version on single line. Used by multiple tools: [node-version-usage](https://github.com/shadowspawn/node-version-usage)\n- `.nvmrc`: version on single line. Used by `nvm`.\n- if no version file found, look for `engine` as below.\n\nThe `engine` label looks for a `package.json` file and reads the `engines` field to determine compatible Node.js. Requires an installed version of `node`, and uses `npx semver` to resolve complex ranges.\n\nThere is support for the named release streams:\n\n- `argon`, `boron`, `carbon`: codenames for LTS release streams\n\nThese Node.js support aliases may be used, although simply resolve to the latest matching version:\n\n- `active`, `lts_active`, `lts_latest`, `lts`, `current`, `supported`\n\nThe last version form is for specifying [other releases](https://nodejs.org/download) available using the name of the remote download folder optionally followed by the complete or incomplete version.\n\n- `nightly`\n- `test/v11.0.0-test20180528`\n- `rc/10`\n\n## Removing Versions\n\nRemove some cached versions:\n\n    n rm 0.9.4 v0.10.0\n\nRemoving all cached versions except the installed version:\n\n    n prune\n\nRemove the installed Node.js (does not affect the cached versions). This can be useful\nto revert to the system version of node (if in a different location), or if you no longer\nwish to use node and npm, or are switching to a different way of managing them.\n\n    n uninstall\n\n## Using Downloaded Node.js Versions Without Reinstalling\n\nThere are three commands for working directly with your downloaded versions of Node.js, without reinstalling.\n\nYou can show the path to the downloaded `node` version:\n\n    $ n which 6.14.3\n    /usr/local/n/versions/6.14.3/bin/node\n\nOr run a downloaded `node` version with the `n run` command:\n\n    n run 8.11.3 --debug some.js\n\nOr execute a command with `PATH` modified so `node` and `npm` will be from the downloaded Node.js version.\n(NB: `npm` run this way will be using global node_modules from the target node version folder.)\n\n    n exec 10 my-script --fast test\n    n exec lts zsh\n\n## Preserving npm\n\nA Node.js install normally also includes `npm`,  `npx`, and `corepack`, but you may wish to preserve your current (especially newer) versions using `--preserve`:\n\n    $ npm install -g npm@latest\n    ...\n    $ npm --version\n    6.13.7\n    # Node.js 8.17.0 includes (older) npm 6.13.4\n    $ n -p 8\n       installed : v8.17.0\n    $ npm --version\n    6.13.7\n\nYou can make this the default by setting the environment variable to a non-empty string. There are separate environment variables for `npm` and `corepack`:\n\n    export N_PRESERVE_NPM=1\n    export N_PRESERVE_COREPACK=1\n\nYou can be explicit to get the desired behaviour whatever the environment variables:\n\n    n --preserve nightly\n    n --no-preserve latest\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nCommand line help can be obtained from `n --help`.\n\nList matching remote versions available for download:\n\n    n ls-remote lts\n    n ls-remote latest\n    n lsr 10\n    n --all lsr\n\nList downloaded versions in cache:\n\n    n ls\n\nDisplay diagnostics to help resolve problems:\n\n    n doctor\n\n## Custom Source\n\nIf you would like to use a different Node.js mirror which has the same layout as the default <https://nodejs.org/dist/>, you can define `N_NODE_MIRROR`.\nThe most common example is from users in China who can define:\n\n    export N_NODE_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/node\n\nIf the custom mirror requires authentication you can add the [url-encoded](https://urlencode.org) username and password into the URL. e.g.\n\n    export N_NODE_MIRROR=https://encoded-username:encoded-password@host:port/path\n\nThere is also `N_NODE_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR` for a different mirror with same layout as the default <https://nodejs.org/download>.\n\n## Custom Architecture\n\nBy default `n` picks the binaries matching your system architecture. For example, on a 64 bit system `n` will download 64 bit binaries.\n\nOn a Mac with Apple silicon:\n\n- for Node.js 16 and higher, `n` defaults to arm64 binaries which run natively\n- for older versions of Node.js, `n` defaults to x64 binaries which run in Rosetta 2\n\nYou can override the default architecture by using the `-a` or `--arch` option.\n\ne.g. reinstall latest version of Node.js with x64 binaries:\n\n    n rm current\n    n --arch x64 current\n\n## Optional Environment Variables\n\nThe `n` command downloads and installs to `/usr/local` by default, but you may override this location by defining `N_PREFIX`.\nTo change the location to say `$HOME/.n`, add lines like the following to your shell initialization file:\n\n    export N_PREFIX=$HOME/.n\n    export PATH=$N_PREFIX/bin:$PATH\n\nIf you want to store the downloads under a different location, use `N_CACHE_PREFIX`. This does *not* affect the currently active\nnode version.\n\n`n` defaults to using xz compressed Node.js tarballs for the download if it is likely tar on the system supports xz decompression.\nYou can override the automatic choice by setting an environment variable to zero or non-zero:\n\n    export N_USE_XZ=0 # to disable\n    export N_USE_XZ=1 # to enable\n\nYou can be explicit to get the desired behaviour whatever the environment variable:\n\n    n install --use-xz nightly\n    n install --no-use-xz latest\n\nIn brief:\n\n- `N_NODE_MIRROR`: See [Custom source](#custom-source)\n- `N_NODE_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR`: See [Custom source](#custom-source)\n- support for [NO_COLOR](https://no-color.org) and [CLICOLOR=0](https://bixense.com/clicolors) for controlling use of ANSI color codes\n- `N_MAX_REMOTE_MATCHES` to change the default `ls-remote` maximum of 20 matching versions\n- `N_PRESERVE_NPM`: See [Preserving npm](#preserving-npm)\n- `N_PRESERVE_COREPACK`: See [Preserving npm](#preserving-npm)\n\n## How It Works\n\n`n` downloads a prebuilt Node.js package and installs to a single prefix (e.g. `/usr/local`). This overwrites the previous version. The `bin` folder in this location should be in your `PATH` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`).\n\nThe downloads are kept in a cache folder to be used for reinstalls. The downloads are also available for limited use using `n which` and `n run` and `n exec`.\n\nThe global `npm` packages are not changed by the install, with the\nexception of `npm` itself which is part of the Node.js install."
