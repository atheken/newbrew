  "readme": "# C-Reduce\n\n## About \n\nC-Reduce is a tool that takes a large C or C++ program that has a\nproperty of interest (such as triggering a compiler bug) and\nautomatically produces a much smaller C/C++ program that has the same\nproperty.  It is intended for use by people who discover and report\nbugs in compilers and other tools that process C/C++ code.\n\n*NOTE:* C-Reduce happens to do a pretty good job reducing the size of\nprograms in languages other than C/C++, such as JavaScript and Rust.\nIf you need to reduce programs in some other language, please give it\na try.\n\nDocumentation and other information can be found at the [C-Reduce web\npage](http://embed.cs.utah.edu/creduce/)\n\n## Installation\n\nSee [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).\n\n## Notes\n\n1. When set to use more than one core, C-Reduce can cause space in\n`/tmp` to be leaked. This happens because sometimes C-Reduce will kill\na compiler invocation when a result that is computed in parallel makes\nit clear that that compiler invocation is no longer useful. If the\ncompiler leaves files in `/tmp` when it is killed, C-Reduce has no way\nto discover and remove the files. You will need to do this manually\nfrom time to time if temporary file space is limited. The leakage is\ntypically pretty slow. If you need to avoid this problem altogether,\nyou can run C-Reduce on a single core (using `--n 1`) in which case\nC-Reduce will never kill a running compiler instance. Alternatively, a\ncommand line option such as `-pipe` (supported by GCC) may suppress\nthe creation of temporary files altogether. Another possibility is to\nset the `TMPDIR` environment variable to something like\n`/tmp/creduce-stuff` before invoking C-Reduce -- assuming that the\ntools you are invoking respect this variable.\n\n2. Each invocation of the interestingness test is performed in a fresh\ntemporary directory containing a copy of the file that is being\nreduced. If your interestingness test requires access to other files,\nyou should either copy them into the current working directory or else\nrefer to them using an absolute path."
