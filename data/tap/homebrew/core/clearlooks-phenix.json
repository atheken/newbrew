  "readme": "## Overview\n\nThe Clearlooks-Phénix project aims at creating a GTK3 port of Clearlooks, the default theme for Gnome 2. Style is also included for GTK2, Unity and for Metacity, Openbox and Xfwm4 window managers.\n\nHere are screenshots (if applicable, click to see the original image):\n\n<a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpfleury/clearlooks-phenix/master/doc/exemple1.png\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpfleury/clearlooks-phenix/master/doc/exemple1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of a Gnome 3 desktop (fallback mode) with the Clearlooks-Phénix theme\" width=\"658\" height=\"493\" /></a>\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpfleury/clearlooks-phenix/master/doc/exemple2.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of gedit 3 with the Clearlooks-Phénix theme\" width=\"659\" height=\"537\" />\n\n<a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpfleury/clearlooks-phenix/master/doc/exemple3.png\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpfleury/clearlooks-phenix/master/doc/exemple3.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of GTK+ Widget Factory with the Clearlooks-Phénix theme\" width=\"658\" height=\"435\" /></a>\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Requirements for Clearlooks-Phénix v1: packages `gtk2-engines` (if GTK2 applications are used) and `gnome-themes-standard`.\n\n- Requirements for Clearlooks-Phénix v2: packages `gtk2-engines` (if GTK2 applications are used), `gnome-themes-standard` and `gtk3-engines-unico`.\n\n- Requirements for Clearlooks-Phénix v3 and newer: package `gtk2-engines` (if GTK2 applications are used).\n\n## Installation\n\n- Download the appropriate version according to your situation:\n\n\t- for GTK 3.0 and 3.2: [download Clearlooks-Phénix v1](https://github.com/jpfleury/clearlooks-phenix/archive/v1.zip);\n\t\n\t- for GTK 3.4: [download Clearlooks-Phénix v2](https://github.com/jpfleury/clearlooks-phenix/archive/v2.zip);\n\t\n\t- for GTK 3.6: [download Clearlooks-Phénix v3](https://github.com/jpfleury/clearlooks-phenix/archive/v3.zip);\n\t\n\t- for GTK 3.8: [download Clearlooks-Phénix v4](https://github.com/jpfleury/clearlooks-phenix/archive/v4.zip);\n\t\n\t- for GTK 3.10 and 3.12: [download Clearlooks-Phénix v5](https://github.com/jpfleury/clearlooks-phenix/archive/v5.zip);\n\t\n\t- for GTK 3.14: [download Clearlooks-Phénix v6](https://github.com/jpfleury/clearlooks-phenix/archive/v6.zip);\n\t\n\t- for GTK 3.20: [download Clearlooks-Phénix v7](https://github.com/jpfleury/clearlooks-phenix/archive/master.zip).\n\t\n\tTo find your GTK version:\n\t\n\t- You can check in your package manager the version of the package `libgtk-3-0`.\n\t\n\t- If you use Ubuntu, here's a correspondence between its versions and those of GTK (for a default installation of Ubuntu):\n\t\n\t\t- Ubuntu 11.10: GTK 3.2\n\t\t- Ubuntu 12.04: GTK 3.4\n\t\t- Ubuntu 12.10 and 13.04: GTK 3.6\n\t\t- Ubuntu 13.10: GTK 3.8\n\t\t- Ubuntu 14.04: GTK 3.10\n\t\t- Ubuntu 14.10: GTK 3.12\n\t\t- Ubuntu 15.04: GTK 3.14\n\t\t- Ubuntu 15.10: GTK 3.16\n\t\t- Ubuntu 16.04: GTK 3.18\n\t\t- Ubuntu 16.10: GTK 3.20\n\n- Extract the archive.\n\n- Rename the extracted folder to `Clearlooks-Phenix`.\n\n- Copy the folder `Clearlooks-Phenix` in one of the following two locations:\n\n\t- `~/.themes/` for the current user;\n\t\n\t- `/usr/share/themes/` for all users, including style for programs ran with root privileges (e.g. Synaptic).\n\n### Selection\n\nThe theme must be selected once the installation is complete:\n\n- On Gnome: with [gnome-tweak-tool](https://live.gnome.org/GnomeTweakTool), by setting *Theme > Window theme* and *Theme > GTK+ theme*, or in a terminal:\n\n\t\tdconf write /org/gnome/desktop/wm/preferences/theme \\'Clearlooks-Phenix\\'\n\t\tdconf write /org/gnome/desktop/interface/gtk-theme \\'Clearlooks-Phenix\\'\n\n- On Xfce: by going to *Settings > Appearence > Style* in the main menu for the GTK theme, and to *Settings > Window Manager > Style* for the Xfwm4 theme, or in a terminal:\n\n\t\txfconf-query -s Clearlooks-Phenix -c xfwm4 -p /general/theme\n\t\txfconf-query -s Clearlooks-Phenix -c xsettings -p /Net/ThemeName\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Desktop managed by Nautilus\n\nBy default, the font color on a desktop managed by Nautilus is black. To set it to white, open the file `gtk-3.0/applications.css` with a text editor, find the code relative to Nautilus:\n\n\t/************\n\t * Nautilus *\n\t ************/\n\t\n\t/*\n\tCOMMENTED\n\tCSS\n\tCODE\n\t*/\n\nand uncomment it, as follows:\n\n\t/************\n\t * Nautilus *\n\t ************/\n\t\n\tUNCOMMENTED\n\tCSS\n\tCODE\n\nTo get a custom color, change the color directly in the file `gtk-3.0/applications.css`.\n\n### Window buttons layout\n\nIf after installing or updating Ubuntu, the window buttons are on the left side, but you want them to the right, run the following command in a terminal:\n\n\tgconftool-2 --set /apps/metacity/general/button_layout --type string \":minimize,maximize,close\"\n\n### Wallpaper\n\nThe wallpaper used for the Gnome 3 desktop screenshot is available in the folder `wallpapers`.\n\n### Icons\n\nThe icon theme used for the same screenshot is Mist, installed with the package `gnome-themes`, under LGPL. However, this package is no longer available with last Ubuntu versions. Here's an easy way to install Mist:\n\n- [Download the archive of the Mist icon theme.](http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/os/i386/Packages/gnome-themes-2.28.1-6.el6.noarch.rpm)\n\n- Extract the archive.\n\n- Copy the folder `usr/share/icons/Mist` in one of the following two locations:\n\n\t- `~/.icons/` for the current user;\n\t\n\t- `/usr/share/icons/` for all users.\n\n- Then, choose Mist:\n\n\t- on Gnome: with gnome-tweak-tool by setting *Theme > Icon theme*;\n\t\n\t- on Xfce: by going to *Settings > Appearence > Icons* in the main menu.\n\n## Development and license\n\nGit is used for revision control.
