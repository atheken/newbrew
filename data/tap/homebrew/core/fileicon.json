Addtionally, a `com.apple.FinderInfo` extended attribute with the custom-icon attribute (flag) is set on the target file or folder itself.\n\nThe icon with the highest resolution measures 512 x 512 pixels, and the input\nimage is scaled accordingly.  \nNote that input images that aren't square can result in distorted icons;\nfor best results, provide square images.\n\nIf you supply an input path to a _symlink_, it is invariably its\n_target_ that is used for the operation; symlinks themselves cannot have\nicons associated with them.\n\nSee also: [Icon Changer](https://github.com/chris1111/Icon-Changer), a GUI utility that uses `fileicon` behind the scenes.\n\n# Examples\n\n```sh\n# Assign custom icon derived from image file 'img.png' to file 'foo':\nfileicon set foo img.png\n\n# Remove previously assigned custom icon from folder 'foodir':\nfileicon rm foodir\n\n# Extract custom icon from file 'foo' to icon file 'foo.icns':\nfileicon get foo\n\n# Test if folder 'foodir' has custom icon:\nfileicon test foodir\n```\n\n# Installation\n\n**Supported platforms:**\n\n* **macOS**\n\n**Important**: \n * If you're running macOS 12 (Monterey) or higher, be sure to install at least version 0.3.1 of this utility,\nas it no longer relies on Python (which no longer ships with macOS).\n * Unfortunately, a bug beyond `fileicon`'s control causes the `get` sub-command (for extracting an existing icon) to be excessively slow on macOS 12 (Monterey); this has been fixed in macOS 13 (Ventura).\n\n## Installation via Homebrew\n\nWith [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, run the following:\n\n```sh\nbrew install fileicon\n```\n\n<sup>Tip of the hat to [@danielbayley](https://github.com/danielbayley) for creating and submitting the formula.</sup>\n\n## Installation from the npm registry\n\nWith [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed, install [the package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fileicon) as follows:\n\n```sh\n[sudo] npm install fileicon -g\n```\n\n**Note**:\n\n* Whether you need `sudo` depends on how you installed Node.js and whether you've [changed permissions later](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions); if you get an `EACCES` error, try again with `sudo`.\n* The `-g` ensures [_global_ installation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-globally) and is needed to put `fileicon` in your system's `$PATH`.\n\n## Manual installation\n\n* Download [the CLI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mklement0/fileicon/stable/bin/fileicon) as `fileicon`.\n* Make it executable with `chmod +x fileicon`.\n* Move it or symlink it to a folder in your `$PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin` (requires `sudo`).\n\n# Usage\n\nFind concise usage information below; for complete documentation, read the [manual online](doc/fileicon.md), or, once installed, run `man fileicon` (`fileicon --man` if installed manually).\n\n<!-- DO NOT EDIT THE FENCED CODE BLOCK and RETAIN THIS COMMENT: The fenced code block below is updated by `make update-readme/release` with CLI usage information. -->\n\n```nohighlight\n$ fileicon --help\n\n\nManage custom icons for files and folders on macOS.  \n\nSET a custom icon for a file or folder:\n\n    fileicon set      <fileOrFolder> [<imageFile>]\n\nREMOVE a custom icon from a file or folder:\n\n    fileicon rm       <fileOrFolder>\n\nGET a file or folder's custom icon:\n\n    fileicon get [-f] <fileOrFolder> [<iconOutputFile>]\n\n    -f ... force replacement of existing output file\n\nTEST if a file or folder has a custom icon:\n\n    fileicon test     <fileOrFolder>\n\nAll forms: option -q silences status output.\n\nStandard options: --help, --man, --version, --home\n```\n\n<!-- DO NOT EDIT THE NEXT CHAPTER and RETAIN THIS COMMENT: The next chapter is updated by `make update-readme/release` with the contents of 'LICENSE.md'.
