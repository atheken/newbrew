  "readme": "This Project is Orphaned\n========================\n\nThis project is no longer maintained or developed. Github issue tracking and pull requests have\ntherefore been disabled. The mailing list (see below) is still available for use.\n\nIf you would like to take over this project, you are welcome to do so. Please fork it and\ndevelop the fork for a while. Once there has been 6 months of reasonable activity, please\ncontact Nikolaus@rath.org and I'll be happy to give you ownership of this repository or\nreplace with a pointer to the fork.\n\n\nSSHFS\n=====\n\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nSSHFS allows you to mount a remote filesystem using SFTP. Most SSH\nservers support and enable this SFTP access by default, so SSHFS is\nvery simple to use - there's nothing to do on the server-side.\n\n\nDevelopment Status\n------------------\n\nSSHFS is shipped by all major Linux distributions and has been in\nproduction use across a wide range of systems for many years. However,\nat present SSHFS does not have any active, regular contributors, and\nthere are a number of known issues (see the bugtracker).  The current\nmaintainer continues to apply pull requests and makes regular\nreleases, but unfortunately has no capacity to do any development\nbeyond addressing high-impact issues. When reporting bugs, please\nunderstand that unless you are including a pull request or are\nreporting a critical issue, you will probably not get a response.\n\n\nHow to use\n----------\n\nOnce sshfs is installed (see next section) running it is very simple::\n\n    sshfs [user@]hostname:[directory] mountpoint\n\nIt is recommended to run SSHFS as regular user (not as root).  For\nthis to work the mountpoint must be owned by the user.  If username is\nomitted SSHFS will use the local username. If the directory is\nomitted, SSHFS will mount the (remote) home directory.  If you need to\nenter a password sshfs will ask for it (actually it just runs ssh\nwhich asks for the password if needed).\n\nAlso many ssh options can be specified (see the manual pages for\n*sftp(1)* and *ssh_config(5)*), including the remote port number\n(``-oport=PORT``)\n\nTo unmount the filesystem::\n\n    fusermount -u mountpoint\n\nOn BSD and macOS, to unmount the filesystem::\n\n    umount mountpoint\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nFirst, download the latest SSHFS release from\nhttps://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/releases. You also need libfuse_ 3.1.0 or newer (or a\nsimilar library that provides a libfuse3 compatible interface for your operating\nsystem). Finally, you need the Glib_ library with development headers (which should be\navailable from your operating system's package manager).\n\nTo build and install, we recommend to use Meson_ (version 0.38 or\nnewer) and Ninja_.  After extracting the sshfs tarball, create a\n(temporary) build directory and run Meson::\n\n    $ mkdir build; cd build\n    $ meson ..\n\nNormally, the default build options will work fine. If you\nnevertheless want to adjust them, you can do so with the *mesonconf*\ncommand::\n\n    $ mesonconf                  # list options\n    $ mesonconf -D strip=true    # set an option\n\nTo build, test and install SSHFS, you then use Ninja (running the\ntests requires the `py.test`_ Python module)::\n\n    $ ninja\n    $ python3 -m pytest test/    # optional, but recommended\n    $ sudo ninja install\n\n.. _libfuse: http://github.com/libfuse/libfuse\n.. _Glib: https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/\n.. _Meson: http://mesonbuild.com/\n.. _Ninja: https://ninja-build.org/\n.. _`py.test`: http://www.pytest.org/\n\nGetting Help\n------------\n\nIf you need help, please ask on the <fuse-sshfs@lists.sourceforge.net>\nmailing list (subscribe at\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fuse-sshfs).\n\nPlease report any bugs on the GitHub issue tracker at\nhttps://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/issues."
