  "readme": "# Haru Free PDF Library [![Build Status](https://github.com/libharu/libharu/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/libharu/libharu/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)\n\n  **URL http://libharu.org/**\n\n  **Copyright 2000-2006 (c) Takeshi Kanno**\n\n  **Copyright 2007-2009 (c) Antony Dovgal et al.**\n\nSee INSTALL for instructions on how to install libHaru.\n\n\n# What is Haru Free PDF Library?\n\nHaru is a free, cross platform, open-sourced software library for generating \nPDF. It supports the following features.\n\n   1. Generating PDF files with lines, text, images.\n   2. Outline, text annotation, link annotation.\n   3. Compressing document with deflate-decode.\n   4. Embedding PNG, Jpeg images.\n   5. Embedding Type1 font and TrueType font.\n   6. Creating encrypted PDF files.\n   7. Using various character set (ISO8859-1~16, MSCP1250~8, KOI8-R).\n   8. Supporting CJK fonts and encodings.\n\nYou can add the feature of PDF creation by using Haru without understanding \ncomplicated internal structure of PDF.\n\n\n# The differences from the previous version \n\n\nThe biggest differences are that all code is written in C. \nTo our regret, because internal structures changed greatly, The API is not \ncompatible with previous version.\n\nHowever, the new-version has the following advantages compared with the \nprevious version.\n\n 1. Supported shared-library build.\n    A new-version library is able to be built as shared-library.\n 2. The performance has been greatly improved.\n    A new-version library is about 4-15 times faster than a previous version. \n 3. Supported more features.\n    TrueType font, 128 bit encryption, arc function, and so on.\n\n\n# Supporting platforms\n\nHaru is written in ANSI-C and should compile easily with any compliant C \ncompiler.\nI inspected Haru in the following environment and make files for these \nenvironments are included in a package.\n\n   1. Cygwin + GCC (Microsoft Windows)\n   2. Cygwin + MinGW (Microsoft Windows)\n   3. MSYS + MinGW (Microsoft Windows)\n   3. Microsoft VC++ (Microsoft Windows)\n   4. Borland C++ (Microsoft Windows)\n   5. GCC (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris...)\n\nAlso on platforms except the above, it is easy to build HARU. If you success to build HARU on other platforms, please send makefile to me.\nIn addition, ZLIB and PNGLIB are required when you want to use the features of \ncompression and embedding PNG images. (In the case of Windows, static library \nfiles for several compilers are included in the package for WIndows.  In the \ncase of  most of UNIX, these libraries are usually installed.)\n\n\n# Available development environment\n\nHaru can work as both static-library (.a, .lib) and shared-library (.so, .dll).\nWhen you use it as static-library, It can be used by C and a C++.\nBut when you use it as shared-library, it can be used by many development \nlanguages which support shared library.\nSo far, Haru provides bindings for Ruby, Delphi/Free Pascal and C#.\n\nIf you write bindings for other programming languages, please notice me!\n\n\n# Runtime environment of programs using Haru\n\n1. static-library\n   No runtime files are required.\n\n2. shared-library\n   In Windows, you have to distribute libhpdf.dll with a program. In UNIX you \n   have to distribute libhpdf.so* with a program.\n\n\n\nNOTE:\nIn the UNIX environment, there are the cases that libz.so, libpng.so.x are \nnecessary. About this, please refer to the documentation of PNGLIB and ZLIB.\n\n\n# License\n\nHaru is distributed under the ZLIB/LIBPNG License. Because ZLIB/LIBPNG License \nis one of the freest licenses, You can use Haru for various purposes.\n\nThe license of Haru is as follows.\n\nCopyright (C) 1999-2006 Takeshi Kanno\nCopyright (C) 2007-2009 Antony Dovgal\n\nThis software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty.\n\nIn no event will the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the \nuse of this software.\n\nPermission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,including \ncommercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it freely, subject \nto the following restrictions:\n\n 1.
