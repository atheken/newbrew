Easily [install the binary](#installation) to try it out. Works with [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft), the powerful SBOM (software bill of materials) tool for container images and filesystems.\n\n### Join our community meetings!\n\n- Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y182OTM4dGt0MjRtajI0NnNzOThiaGtnM29qNEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t\n- Agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZtSAa6fj2a6KRWviTn3WoJm09edvrNUp4Iz_dOjjyY8/edit?usp=sharing (join [this group](https://groups.google.com/g/anchore-oss-community) for write access)\n- All are welcome!\n\nFor commercial support options with Syft or Grype, please [contact Anchore](https://get.anchore.com/contact/)\n\n![grype-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/590471/90276236-9868f300-de31-11ea-8068-4268b6b68529.gif)\n\n## Features\n\n- Scan the contents of a container image or filesystem to find known vulnerabilities.\n- Find vulnerabilities for major operating system packages:\n  - Alpine\n  - Amazon Linux\n  - BusyBox\n  - CentOS\n  - Debian\n  - Distroless\n  - Oracle Linux\n  - Red Hat (RHEL)\n  - Ubuntu\n- Find vulnerabilities for language-specific packages:\n  - Ruby (Gems)\n  - Java (JAR, WAR, EAR, JPI, HPI)\n  - JavaScript (NPM, Yarn)\n  - Python (Egg, Wheel, Poetry, requirements.txt/setup.py files)\n  - Dotnet (deps.json)\n  - Golang (go.mod)\n  - PHP (Composer)\n  - Rust (Cargo)\n- Supports Docker, OCI and [Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) image formats.\n\nIf you encounter an issue, please [let us know using the issue tracker](https://github.com/anchore/grype/issues).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Recommended\n\n```bash\ncurl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/grype/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin\n```\n\nYou can also choose another destination directory and release version for the installation. The destination directory doesn't need to be `/usr/local/bin`, it just needs to be a location found in the user's PATH and writable by the user that's installing Grype.\n\n```\ncurl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/grype/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b <DESTINATION_DIR> <RELEASE_VERSION>\n```\n\n### Homebrew\n\n```bash\nbrew tap anchore/grype\nbrew install grype\n```\n\n### MacPorts\n\nOn macOS, Grype can additionally be installed from the [community maintained port](https://ports.macports.org/port/grype/) via MacPorts:\n\n```bash\nsudo port install grype\n```\n\n**Note**: Currently, Grype is built only for macOS and Linux.\n\n### From source\n\nSee [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md#native-development) for instructions to build and run from source.\n\n### GitHub Actions\n\nIf you're using GitHub Actions, you can simply use our [Grype-based action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/anchore-container-scan) to run vulnerability scans on your code or container images during your CI workflows.\n\n## Getting started\n\n[Install the binary](#installation), and make sure that `grype` is available in your path. To scan for vulnerabilities in an image:\n\n```\ngrype <image>\n```\n\nThe above command scans for vulnerabilities that are visible in the container (i.e., the squashed representation of the image). To include software from all image layers in the vulnerability scan, regardless of its presence in the final image, provide `--scope all-layers`:\n\n```\ngrype <image> --scope all-layers\n```\n\nTo run grype from a Docker container so it can scan a running container, use the following command:\n\n```yml\ndocker run --rm \\\n--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n--name Grype anchore/grype:latest \\\n$(ImageName):$(ImageTag)\n```\n\n### Supported sources\n\nGrype can scan a variety of sources beyond those found in Docker.\n\n```\n# scan a container image archive (from the result of `docker image save ...`, `podman save ...`, or `skopeo copy` commands)\ngrype path/to/image.tar\n\n# scan a Singularity Image Format (SIF) container\ngrype path/to/image.sif\n\n# scan a directory\ngrype dir:path/to/dir\n```\n\nSources can be explicitly provided with a scheme:\n\n```\npodman:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          use images from the Podman daemon\ndocker:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          use images from the Docker daemon\ndocker-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar   use a tarball from disk for archives created from \"docker save\"\noci-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar      use a tarball from disk for OCI archives (from Skopeo or otherwise)\noci-dir:path/to/yourimage              read directly from a path on disk for OCI layout directories (from Skopeo or otherwise)\nsingularity:path/to/yourimage.sif      read directly from a Singularity Image Format (SIF) container on disk\ndir:path/to/yourproject                read directly from a path on disk (any directory)\nsbom:path/to/syft.json                 read Syft JSON from path on disk\nregistry:yourrepo/yourimage:tag        pull image directly from a registry (no container runtime required)\n```\n\nIf an image source is not provided and cannot be detected from the given reference it is assumed the image should be pulled from the Docker daemon.\nIf docker is not present, then the Podman daemon is attempted next, followed by reaching out directly to the image registry last.\n\n\nThis default behavior can be overridden with the `default-image-pull-source` configuration option (See [Configuration](https://github.com/anchore/grype#configuration) for more details).\n\nUse SBOMs for even faster vulnerability scanning in Grype:\n\n```\n# Then scan for new vulnerabilities as frequently as needed\ngrype sbom:./sbom.json\n\n# (You can also pipe the SBOM into Grype)\ncat ./sbom.json | grype\n```\n\nGrype supports input of [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft), [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/), and [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/)\nSBOM formats. If Syft has generated any of these file types, they should have the appropriate information to work properly with Grype.\nIt is also possible to use SBOMs generated by other tools with varying degrees of success. Two things that make Grype matching\nmore successful are inclusion of CPE and Linux distribution information. If an SBOM does not include any CPE information, it\nis possible to generate these based on package information using the `--add-cpes-if-none` flag. To specify a distribution,\nuse the `--distro <distro>:<version>` flag. A full example is:\n\n```\ngrype --add-cpes-if-none --distro alpine:3.10 sbom:some-apline-3.10.spdx.json\n```\n\n### Working with attestations\nGrype supports scanning SBOMs as input via stdin. Users can use [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) to verify attestations\nwith an SBOM as its content to scan an image for vulnerabilities:\n```\nCOSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify-attestation caphill4/java-spdx-tools:latest \\\n| jq -r .payload \\\n| base64 --decode \\\n| jq -r .predicate.Data \\\n| grype\n```\n\n### Vulnerability Summary\n\n#### Basic Grype Vulnerability Data Shape\n\n```json\n {\n  \"vulnerability\": {\n    ...\n  },\n  \"relatedVulnerabilities\": [\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"matchDetails\": [\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"artifact\": {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- **Vulnerability**: All information on the specific vulnerability that was directly matched on (e.g. ID, severity, CVSS score, fix information, links for more information)\n- **RelatedVulnerabilities**: Information pertaining to vulnerabilities found to be related to the main reported vulnerability. Maybe the vulnerability we matched on was a GitHub Security Advisory, which has an upstream CVE (in the authoritative national vulnerability database). In these cases we list the upstream vulnerabilities here.\n- **MatchDetails**: This section tries to explain what we searched for while looking for a match and exactly what details on the package and vulnerability that lead to a match.\n- **Artifact**: This is a subset of the information that we know about the package (when compared to the [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) json output, we summarize the metadata section).\n  This has information about where within the container image or directory we found the package, what kind of package it is, licensing info, pURLs, CPEs, etc.\n\n### Excluding file paths\n\nGrype can exclude files and paths from being scanned within a source by using glob expressions\nwith one or more `--exclude` parameters:\n\n```\ngrype <source> --exclude './out/**/*.json' --exclude /etc\n```\n\n**Note:** in the case of _image scanning_, since the entire filesystem is scanned it is\npossible to use absolute paths like `/etc` or `/usr/**/*.txt` whereas _directory scans_\nexclude files _relative to the specified directory_. For example: scanning `/usr/foo` with\n`--exclude ./package.json` would exclude `/usr/foo/package.json` and `--exclude '**/package.json'`\nwould exclude all `package.json` files under `/usr/foo`. For _directory scans_,\nit is required to begin path expressions with `./`, `*/`, or `**/`, all of which\nwill be resolved _relative to the specified scan directory_. Keep in mind, your shell\nmay attempt to expand wildcards, so put those parameters in single quotes, like:\n`'**/*.json'`.\n\n### External Sources\n\nGrype can be configured to incorporate external data sources for added fidelity in vulnerability matching. This\nfeature is currently disabled by default. To enable this feature add the following to the grype config:\n\n```yaml\nexternal-sources:\n  enable: true\n  maven:\n    search-upstream-by-sha1: true\n    base-url: https://search.maven.org/solrsearch/select\n```\n\nYou can also configure the base-url if you're using another registry as your maven endpoint.\n\n### Output formats\n\nThe output format for Grype is configurable as well:\n\n```\ngrype <image> -o <format>\n```\n\nWhere the formats available are:\n\n- `table`: A columnar summary (default).\n- `cyclonedx`: An XML report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.4 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).\n- `cyclonedx-json`: A JSON report conforming to the [CycloneDX 1.4 specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/).\n- `json`: Use this to get as much information out of Grype as possible!\n- `template`: Lets the user specify the output format. See [\"Using templates\"](#using-templates) below.\n\n### Using templates\n\nGrype lets you define custom output formats, using [Go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/). Here's how it works:\n\n- Define your format as a Go template, and save this template as a file.\n\n- Set the output format to \"template\" (`-o template`).\n\n- Specify the path to the template file (`-t ./path/to/custom.template`).\n\n- Grype's template processing uses the same data models as the `json` output format — so if you're wondering what data is available as you author a template, you can use the output from `grype <image> -o json` as a reference.\n\n**Please note:** Templates can access information about the system they are running on, such as environment variables. You should never run untrusted templates.\n\nThere are several example templates in the [templates](https://github.com/anchore/grype/tree/main/templates) directory in the Grype source which can serve a starting point for a custom output format. For example, [csv.tmpl](https://github.com/anchore/grype/blob/main/templates/csv.tmpl) produces a vulnerability report in CSV (comma separated value) format:\n\n```text\n\"Package\",\"Version Installed\",\"Vulnerability ID\",\"Severity\"\n\"coreutils\",\"8.30-3ubuntu2\",\"CVE-2016-2781\",\"Low\"\n\"libc-bin\",\"2.31-0ubuntu9\",\"CVE-2016-10228\",\"Negligible\"\n\"libc-bin\",\"2.31-0ubuntu9\",\"CVE-2020-6096\",\"Low\"\n...\n```\n\nYou can also find the template for the default \"table\" output format in the same place.\n\nGrype also includes a vast array of utility templating functions from [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) apart from the default golang [text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#hdr-Functions) to allow users to customize the output from Grype.\n\n### Gating on severity of vulnerabilities\n\nYou can have Grype exit with an error if any vulnerabilities are reported at or above the specified severity level. This comes in handy when using Grype within a script or CI pipeline. To do this, use the `--fail-on <severity>` CLI flag.\n\nFor example, here's how you could trigger a CI pipeline failure if any vulnerabilities are found in the `ubuntu:latest` image with a severity of \"medium\" or higher:\n\n```\ngrype ubuntu:latest --fail-on medium\n```\n\n### Specifying matches to ignore\n\nIf you're seeing Grype report **false positives** or any other vulnerability matches that you just don't want to see, you can tell Grype to **ignore** matches by specifying one or more _\"ignore rules\"_ in your Grype configuration file (e.g. `~/.grype.yaml`). This causes Grype not to report any vulnerability matches that meet the criteria specified by any of your ignore rules.\n\nEach rule can specify any combination of the following criteria:\n\n- vulnerability ID (e.g. `\"CVE-2008-4318\"`)\n- namespace (e.g. `\"nvd\"`)\n- fix state (allowed values: `\"fixed\"`, `\"not-fixed\"`, `\"wont-fix\"`, or `\"unknown\"`)\n- package name (e.g. `\"libcurl\"`)\n- package version (e.g. `\"1.5.1\"`)\n- package language (e.g. `\"python\"`; these values are defined [here](https://github.com/anchore/syft/blob/main/syft/pkg/language.go#L14-L23))\n- package type (e.g. `\"npm\"`; these values are defined [here](https://github.com/anchore/syft/blob/main/syft/pkg/type.go#L10-L24))\n- package location (e.g. `\"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/**\"`; supports glob patterns)\n\nHere's an example `~/.grype.yaml` that demonstrates the expected format for ignore rules:\n\n```yaml\nignore:\n  # This is the full set of supported rule fields:\n  - vulnerability: CVE-2008-4318\n    fix-state: unknown\n    package:\n      name: libcurl\n      version: 1.5.1\n      type: npm\n      location: \"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/**\"\n\n  # We can make rules to match just by vulnerability ID:\n  - vulnerability: CVE-2014-54321\n\n  # ...or just by a single package field:\n  - package:\n      type: gem\n```\n\nVulnerability matches will be ignored if **any** rules apply to the match. A rule is considered to apply to a given vulnerability match only if **all** fields specified in the rule apply to the vulnerability match.\n\nWhen you run Grype while specifying ignore rules, the following happens to the vulnerability matches that are \"ignored\":\n\n- Ignored matches are **completely hidden** from Grype's output, except for when using the `json` or `template` output formats; however, in these two formats, the ignored matches are **removed** from the existing `matches` array field, and they are placed in a new `ignoredMatches` array field. Each listed ignored match also has an additional field, `appliedIgnoreRules`, which is an array of any rules that caused Grype to ignore this vulnerability match.\n\n- Ignored matches **do not** factor into Grype's exit status decision when using `--fail-on <severity>`. For instance, if a user specifies `--fail-on critical`, and all of the vulnerability matches found with a \"critical\" severity have been _ignored_, Grype will exit zero.\n\n**Note:** Please continue to **[report](https://github.com/anchore/grype/issues/new/choose)** any false positives you see! Even if you can reliably filter out false positives using ignore rules, it's very helpful to the Grype community if we have as much knowledge about Grype's false positives as possible. This helps us continuously improve Grype!\n\n### Showing only \"fixed\" vulnerabilities\n\nIf you only want Grype to report vulnerabilities **that have a confirmed fix**, you can use the `--only-fixed` flag. (This automatically adds [ignore rules](#specifying-matches-to-ignore) into Grype's configuration, such that vulnerabilities that aren't fixed will be ignored.)\n\nFor example, here's a scan of Alpine 3.10:\n\n```\nNAME          INSTALLED  FIXED-IN   VULNERABILITY   SEVERITY\napk-tools     2.10.6-r0  2.10.7-r0  CVE-2021-36159  Critical\nlibcrypto1.1  1.1.1k-r0             CVE-2021-3711   Critical\nlibcrypto1.1  1.1.1k-r0             CVE-2021-3712   High\nlibssl1.1     1.1.1k-r0             CVE-2021-3712   High\nlibssl1.1     1.1.1k-r0             CVE-2021-3711   Critical\n```\n\n...and here's the same scan, but adding the flag `--only-fixed`:\n\n```\nNAME       INSTALLED  FIXED-IN   VULNERABILITY   SEVERITY\napk-tools  2.10.6-r0  2.10.7-r0  CVE-2021-36159  Critical\n```\n\nIf you want Grype to only report vulnerabilities **that do not have a confirmed fix**, you can use the `--only-notfixed` flag. (This automatically adds [ignore rules](#specifying-matches-to-ignore) into Grype's configuration, such that vulnerabilities that are fixed will be ignored.)\n\n## Grype's database\n\nWhen Grype performs a scan for vulnerabilities, it does so using a vulnerability database that's stored on your local filesystem, which is constructed by pulling data from a variety of publicly available vulnerability data sources. These sources include:\n\n- Alpine Linux SecDB: https://secdb.alpinelinux.org/\n- Amazon Linux ALAS: https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/alas.rss\n- RedHat RHSAs: https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/\n- Debian Linux CVE Tracker: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/json\n- Github GHSAs: https://github.com/advisories\n- National Vulnerability Database (NVD): https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds\n- Oracle Linux OVAL: https://linux.oracle.com/security/oval/\n- RedHat Linux Security Data: https://access.redhat.com/hydra/rest/securitydata/\n- Suse Linux OVAL: https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/oval/\n- Ubuntu Linux Security: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/\n\nBy default, Grype automatically manages this database for you. Grype checks for new updates to the vulnerability database to make sure that every scan uses up-to-date vulnerability information. This behavior is configurable. For more information, see the [Managing Grype's database](#managing-grypes-database) section.\n\n### How database updates work\n\nGrype's vulnerability database is a SQLite file, named `vulnerability.db`. Updates to the database are atomic: the entire database is replaced and then treated as \"readonly\" by Grype.\n\nGrype's first step in a database update is discovering databases that are available for retrieval. Grype does this by requesting a \"listing file\" from a public endpoint:\n\n`https://toolbox-data.anchore.io/grype/databases/listing.json`\n\nThe listing file contains entries for every database that's available for download.\n\nHere's an example of an entry in the listing file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"built\": \"2021-10-21T08:13:41Z\",\n  \"version\": 3,\n  \"url\": \"https://toolbox-data.anchore.io/grype/databases/vulnerability-db_v3_2021-10-21T08:13:41Z.tar.gz\",\n  \"checksum\": \"sha256:8c99fb4e516f10b304f026267c2a73a474e2df878a59bf688cfb0f094bfe7a91\"\n}\n```\n\nWith this information, Grype can select the correct database (the most recently built database with the current schema version), download the database, and verify the database's integrity using the listed `checksum` value.\n\n### Managing Grype's database\n\n> **Note:** During normal usage, _there is no need for users to manage Grype's database!_ Grype manages its database behind the scenes. However, for users that need more control, Grype provides options to manage the database more explicitly.\n\n#### Local database cache directory\n\nBy default, the database is cached on the local filesystem in the directory `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/grype/db/<SCHEMA-VERSION>/`. For example, on macOS, the database would be stored in `~/Library/Caches/grype/db/3/`. (For more information on XDG paths, refer to the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).)\n\nYou can set the cache directory path using the environment variable `GRYPE_DB_CACHE_DIR`.\n\n#### Data staleness\n\nGrype needs up-to-date vulnerability information to provide accurate matches. By default, it will fail execution if the local database was not built in the last 5 days. The data staleness check is configurable via the environment variable `GRYPE_DB_MAX_ALLOWED_BUILT_AGE` and `GRYPE_DB_VALIDATE_AGE` or the field `max-allowed-built-age` and `validate-age`, under `db`. It uses [golang's time duration syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration). Set `GRYPE_DB_VALIDATE_AGE` or `validate-age` to `false` to disable staleness check.\n\n#### Offline and air-gapped environments\n\nBy default, Grype checks for a new database on every run, by making a network call over the Internet. You can tell Grype not to perform this check by setting the environment variable `GRYPE_DB_AUTO_UPDATE` to `false`.\n\nAs long as you place Grype's `vulnerability.db` and `metadata.json` files in the cache directory for the expected schema version, Grype has no need to access the network. Additionally, you can get a listing of the database archives available for download from the `grype db list` command in an online environment, download the database archive, transfer it to your offline environment, and use `grype db import <db-archive-path>` to use the given database in an offline capacity.\n\nIf you would like to distribute your own Grype databases internally without needing to use `db import` manually you can leverage Grype's DB update mechanism. To do this you can craft your own `listing.json` file similar to the one found publically (see `grype db list -o raw` for an example of our public `listing.json` file) and change the download URL to point to an internal endpoint (e.g. a private S3 bucket, an internal file server, etc). Any internal installation of Grype can receive database updates automatically by configuring the `db.update-url` (same as the `GRYPE_DB_UPDATE_URL` environment variable) to point to the hosted `listing.json` file you've crafted.\n\n#### CLI commands for database management\n\nGrype provides database-specific CLI commands for users that want to control the database from the command line. Here are some of the useful commands provided:\n\n`grype db status` — report the current status of Grype's database (such as its location, build date, and checksum)\n\n`grype db check` — see if updates are available for the database\n\n`grype db update` — ensure the latest database has been downloaded to the cache directory (Grype performs this operation at the beginning of every scan by default)\n\n`grype db list` — download the listing file configured at `db.update-url` and show databases that are available for download\n\n`grype db import` — provide grype with a database archive to explicitly use (useful for offline DB updates)\n\nFind complete information on Grype's database commands by running `grype db --help`.\n\n## Shell completion\n\nGrype supplies shell completion through its CLI implementation ([cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/shell_completions.md)). Generate the completion code for your shell by running one of the following commands:\n\n- `grype completion <bash|zsh|fish>`\n- `go run ./cmd/grype completion <bash|zsh|fish>`\n\nThis will output a shell script to STDOUT, which can then be used as a completion script for Grype. Running one of the above commands with the\n`-h` or `--help` flags will provide instructions on how to do that for your chosen shell.\n\n## Private Registry Authentication\n\n### Local Docker Credentials\n\nWhen a container runtime is not present, grype can still utilize credentials configured in common credential sources (such as `~/.docker/config.json`).\nIt will pull images from private registries using these credentials. The config file is where your credentials are stored when authenticating with private registries via some command like `docker login`.\nFor more information see the `go-containerregistry` [documentation](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/pkg/authn).\n\nAn example `config.json` looks something like this:\n\n```\n// config.json\n{\n\t\"auths\": {\n\t\t\"registry.example.com\": {\n\t\t\t\"username\": \"AzureDiamond\",\n\t\t\t\"password\": \"hunter2\"\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nYou can run the following command as an example. It details the mount/environment configuration a container needs to access a private registry:\n\n`docker run -v ./config.json:/config/config.json -e \"DOCKER_CONFIG=/config\" anchore/grype:latest <private_image>`\n\n### Docker Credentials in Kubernetes\n\nThe below section shows a simple workflow on how to mount this config file as a secret into a container on kubernetes.\n\n1.  Create a secret. The value of `config.json` is important. It refers to the specification detailed [here](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/pkg/authn#the-config-file).\n    Below this section is the `secret.yaml` file that the pod configuration will consume as a volume.\n    The key `config.json` is important. It will end up being the name of the file when mounted into the pod.\n    ``` # secret.yaml\n\n        apiVersion: v1\n        kind: Secret\n        metadata:\n          name: registry-config\n          namespace: grype\n        data:\n          config.json: <base64 encoded config.json>\n        ```\n\n        `kubectl apply -f secret.yaml`\n\n2.  Create your pod running grype. The env `DOCKER_CONFIG` is important because it advertises where to look for the credential file.\n    In the below example, setting `DOCKER_CONFIG=/config` informs grype that credentials can be found at `/config/config.json`.\n    This is why we used `config.json` as the key for our secret. When mounted into containers the secrets' key is used as the filename.\n    The `volumeMounts` section mounts our secret to `/config`. The `volumes` section names our volume and leverages the secret we created in step one.\n    ``` # pod.yaml\n\n        apiVersion: v1\n        kind: Pod\n        spec:\n          containers:\n            - image: anchore/grype:latest\n              name: grype-private-registry-demo\n              env:\n                - name: DOCKER_CONFIG\n                  value: /config\n              volumeMounts:\n              - mountPath: /config\n                name: registry-config\n                readOnly: true\n              args:\n                - <private_image>\n          volumes:\n          - name: registry-config\n            secret:\n              secretName: registry-config\n        ```\n\n        `kubectl apply -f pod.yaml`\n\n3.  The user can now run `kubectl logs grype-private-registry-demo`. The logs should show the grype analysis for the `<private_image>` provided in the pod configuration.\n\nUsing the above information, users should be able to configure private registry access without having to do so in the `grype` or `syft` configuration files.\nThey will also not be dependent on a docker daemon, (or some other runtime software) for registry configuration and access.\n\n## Configuration\n\nDefault configuration search paths:\n\n- `.grype.yaml`\n- `.grype/config.yaml`\n- `~/.grype.yaml`\n- `<XDG_CONFIG_HOME>/grype/config.yaml`\n\nYou can also use the `--config` / `-c` flag to provide your own configuration file/path:\n\n```\ngrype <image> -c /path/to/config.yaml\n```\n\nConfiguration options (example values are the default):\n\n```yaml\n# enable/disable checking for application updates on startup\n# same as GRYPE_CHECK_FOR_APP_UPDATE env var\ncheck-for-app-update: true\n\n# allows users to specify which image source should be used to generate the sbom\n# valid values are: registry, docker, podman\n# same as GRYPE_DEFAULT_IMAGE_PULL_SOURCE env var\ndefault-image-pull-source: \"\"\n\n# same as --name;
