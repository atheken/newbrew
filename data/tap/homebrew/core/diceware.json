Reinhold on http://diceware.com . It generates passphrases\nby concatenating words randomly picked from wordlists. For instance::\n\n  $ diceware\n  MyraPend93rdSixthEagleAid\n\nThe passphrase contains by default six words (with first char\ncapitalized) without any separator chars. Optionally you can let\n`diceware` insert special chars into the passphrase.\n\n`diceware` supports several sources of randomness (including real life\ndice) and different wordlists (including cryptographically signed\nones).\n\n.. contents::\n\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nThis Python package can be installed via pip_::\n\n  $ pip install diceware\n\nThe exact way depends on your operating system.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nOnce installed, use ``--help`` to list all available options::\n\n  $ diceware --help\n  usage: diceware [-h] [-n NUM] [-c | --no-caps] [-s NUM] [-d DELIMITER]\n                  [-r SOURCE] [-w [NAME [NAME ...]]] [--dice-sides N] [-v]\n                  [--version]\n                  [INFILE]\n\n  Create a passphrase\n\n  positional arguments:\n    INFILE                Input wordlist. `-' will read from stdin.\n\n  optional arguments:\n    -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n    -n NUM, --num NUM     number of words to concatenate. Default: 6\n    -c, --caps            Capitalize words. This is the default.\n    --no-caps             Turn off capitalization.\n    -s NUM, --specials NUM\n                          Insert NUM special chars into generated word.\n    -d DELIMITER, --delimiter DELIMITER\n                          Separate words by DELIMITER. Empty string by default.\n    -r SOURCE, --randomsource SOURCE\n                          Get randomness from this source. Possible values:\n                          `realdice', `system'. Default: system\n    -w [NAME [NAME ...]], --wordlist [NAME [NAME ...]]\n                          Use words from this wordlist. Possible values: `de',\n                          `de_8k', `en_adjectives', `en_eff', `en_nouns',\n                          `en_securedrop', `pt-br'.\n                          Wordlists are stored in the folder displayed below.\n                          Default: en_eff\n    -v, --verbose         Be verbose. Use several times for increased verbosity.\n    --version             output version information and exit.\n\n  Arguments related to `realdice' randomsource:\n    --dice-sides N        Number of sides of dice. Default: 6\n\n  Wordlists are stored in <WORDLISTS-DIR>\n\nWith ``-n`` you can tell how many words are supposed to be picked for\nyour new passphrase::\n\n  $ diceware -n 1\n  Thud\n\n  $ diceware -n 2\n  KnitMargo\n\nYou can `diceware` additionally let generate special chars to replace\ncharacters in the 'normal' passphrase.  The number of special chars\ngenerated can be determined with the ``-s`` option (*default is zero*)::\n\n  $ diceware -s 2\n  Heroic%unkLon#DmLewJohns\n\nHere ``\"%\"`` and ``\"#\"`` are the special chars.\n\nSpecial chars are taken from the following list::\n\n  ~!#$%^&*()-=+[]\\{}:;\\\"'<>?/0123456789\n\nPlease note that several special chars might replace the same original\nchar, resulting in a passphrase with less special chars than requested.\n\nWith ``-d`` you can advise `diceware` to put a delimiter string\nbetween the words generated::\n\n  $ diceware -d \"_\"\n  Wavy_Baden_400_Whelp_Quest_Macon\n\nBy default we use the empty string as delimiter, which is good for\ncopying via double click on Linux systems. But other delimiters might\nmake your passphrases more readable (and more secure, see\n`Security Traps <#sec-traps>`_ below).\n\nBy default the single phrase words are capitalized, i.e. the first\nchar of each word is made uppercase. This does not necessarily give\nbetter entropy (but protects against entropy loss due to non `prefix\ncode`_, see `Security Traps <#sec-traps>`_ below), and it might\nimprove phrase readability.\n\nYou can nevertheless disable caps with the ``--no-caps`` option::\n\n  $ diceware --no-caps\n  oceanblendbaronferrylistenvalet\n\nThis will leave the input words untouched (upper-case stays upper-case,\nlower-case stays lower-case). It does *not* mean, that all output words will be\nlower-case (except if all words of your wordlist are lowercase).\n\nAs the default lists of `diceware` contain only lower-case terms, here\n``--no-caps`` means in fact lower-case only output, which might be easier to\ntype on smart phones and similar.\n\n`diceware` supports also different sources of randomness, which can be\nchosen with the ``-r <SOURCENAME>`` or ``--randomsource <SOURCENAME>``\noption. Use the ``--help`` option to list all valid values for this\noption.\n\nBy default we use the `random.SystemRandom`_ class of standard Python\nlib but you can also bring your own dice to create randomness::\n\n  $ diceware -r realdice --dice-sides 6\n  Please roll 5 dice (or a single dice 5 times).\n  Enter your 5 dice results, separated by spaces: 6 4 2 3 1\n  Please roll 5 dice (or a single dice 5 times).\n  Enter your 5 dice results, separated by spaces: 5 4 3 6 2\n  ...\n  UnleveledSimilarlyBackboardMurkyOasisReplay\n\nNormally dice have six sides. And this is also the default in\n`diceware` if you do not use ``--dice-sides``. But if you do, you can\ntell how many sides (all) your dice have. More sides will lead to less\nrolls required.\n\n`diceware` comes with an English wordlist provided by the EFF_, which will be\nused by default and contains 7776 (=6^5) different words. This list is\nregistered as ``en_eff``.\n\nAdditionally `diceware` comes with an English wordlist provided by\n`@heartsucker`_, which contains 8192 different words. This list is based off\nthe original diceware list written by Arnold G. Reinhold.\n\nYou can enable a certain (installed) wordlist with the ``-w`` option::\n\n  $ diceware --wordlist en_orig\n  YorkNodePrickEchoToriNiobe\n\nSee ``diceware --help`` for a list of all installed wordlists.\n\nYou can also build phrases from adjectives and nouns (yet in english only)\nusing the included `en_adjectives` and `en_nouns` lists. For that you specify\nthese two wordlists after each other::\n\n  $ diceware -n 1 -w en_adjectives en_nouns\n  TediousPerimeter\n\nThese adjective/noun phrases might be easier to memorize.\n\nIf you do not like the wordlists provided, you can use your own\none. Any `INFILE` provided will be parsed line by line and each line\nconsidered a possible word. For instance::\n\n  $ echo -e \"hi\\nhello\\n\" > mywordlist.txt\n  $ diceware mywordlist.txt\n  HelloHelloHiHiHiHello\n\nWith dash (``-``) as filename you can pipe in wordlists::\n\n  $ echo -e \"hi\\nhello\\n\" | diceware -\n  HiHiHelloHiHiHello\n\nIn custom wordlists we take each line for a valid word and ignore\nempty lines (i.e. lines containing whitespace characters only). Oh,\nand we handle even PGP-signed wordlists.\n\nYou can set customized default values in a configuration file\n``.diceware.ini`` (note the leading dot) placed in your home\ndirectory. This file could look like this::\n\n  [diceware]\n  num = 7\n  caps = off\n  specials = 2\n  delimiter = \"MYDELIMITER\"\n  randomsource = \"system\"\n  wordlist = \"en_securedrop\"\n\nThe options names have to match long argument names, as output by\n``--help``. The values set must meet the requirements valid for\ncommandline usage. All options must be set within a section\n``[diceware]``.\n\n\nWhat is it good for?\n--------------------\n\nNormally, `diceware` passphrases are easier to remember than shorter\npasswords constructed in more or less bizarre ways. But at the same\ntime `diceware` passphrases provide more entropy as `xkcd`_ can show\nwith the famous '936' proof_:\n\n.. image:: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png\n   :align: center\n   :target: http://xkcd.com/936/\n\n.. _xkcd: http://xkcd.com/\n.. _proof: http://xkcd.com/936/\n\nThe standard english wordlist of this `diceware` implementation contains 7776 =\n6^5 different english words. It is the official EFF_ wordlist.  compiled by\n`Joseph Bonneau`_. Therefore, picking a random word from this list gives an\nentropy of nearly 12.9 bits. Picking six words means an entropy of 6 x 12.9 =\n77.54 bits.\n\nThe special chars replacing chars of the originally created passphrase\ngive some more entropy (the more chars you have, the more additional\nentropy), but not much. For instance, for a sixteen chars phrase you\nhave sixteen possibilities to place one of the 36 special chars. That\nmakes 36 x 16 possibilities or an entropy of about 9.17 you can add.\nTo get an entropy increase of at least 10 bits, you have to put a\nspecial char in a phrase with at least 29 chars (while at the same\ntime an additional word would give you 13 bits of extra\nentropy). Therefore you might think again about using special chars in\nyour passphrase.\n\n\nIs it secure?\n-------------\n\nThe security level provided by Diceware_ depends heavily on your\nsource of random. If the delivered randomness is good, then your\npassphrases will be very strong. If instead someone can foresee the\nnumbers generated by a random number generator, your passphrases will\nbe surprisingly weak.\n\nThis Python implementation uses (by default) the\n`random.SystemRandom`_ source provided by Python. On Un*x systems it\naccesses `/dev/urandom`. You might want to follow reports about\nmanipulated random number generators in operating systems closely.\n\nThe Python API of this package allows usage of other sources of\nrandomness when generating passphrases. This includes real dice. See\nthe ``-r`` option.\n\n\n.. _sec-traps:\n\nSecurity Traps\n--------------\n\nThere are issues that might reduce the entropy of the passphrase\ngenerated. One of them is the `prefix code`_ problem:\n\n\nPrefix Code\n...........\n\nIf the wordlist contains, for example, the words::\n\n   \"air\", \"airport\", \"portable\", \"able\"\n\n*and* we switched off caps *and* delimiter chars, then `diceware` might\ngenerate a passphrase containing::\n\n   \"airportable\"\n\nwhich could come from ``air-portable`` or ``airport-able``. We cannot\ntell and an attacker would have less combinations to guess.\n\nTo avoid that, you can leave caps enabled (the default), use any word\ndelimiter except the empty string or use the ``en_eff`` wordlist,\nwhich was checked to be a `prefix code`_ (i.e. it does not contain\nwords that start with other words in the list). The ``pt-br`` is also a secure\n`prefix code`_.\n\nEach of these measures is sufficient to protect you against the\n`prefix code`_ problem.\n\n\nReduced Entropy\n...............\n\nOverall, `diceware` is a kind of mapping input values, dice throws for\ninstance, onto wordlist entries. We normally want each of the words in the\nwordlist to be picked for passphrases with the same probability.\n\nThis, however, is not possible, if the number of wordlist entries is not a\npower of dice sides. In that case we cut some words of the wordlist and inform\nthe user about the matter. Reducing the number of words this way makes it\neasier for attackers to guess the phrase picked.\n\nYou can fix that problem by using longer wordlists.\n\n\nDeveloper Install\n-----------------\n\nDevelopers want to `fork me on github`_::\n\n  $ git clone https://github.com/ulif/diceware.git\n\nWe recommend to create and activate a virtualenv_ first::\n\n  $ cd diceware/\n  $ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.8 py38\n  $ source py38/bin/activate\n  (py38) $\n\nWe support Python versions 2.7, 3.4 to 3.9, and pypy.\n\nNow you can create the devel environment::\n\n  (py38) $ python setup.py dev\n\nThis will fetch test packages (py.test_). You should be able to run\ntests now::\n\n  (py38) $ py.test\n\nIf you have also different Python versions installed you can use tox_\nfor using them all for testing::\n\n  (py38) $ pip install tox   # only once\n  (py38) $ tox\n\nShould run tests in all supported Python versions.\n\n\nDocumentation Install\n.....................\n\nThe docs can be generated with Sphinx_. The needed packages are\ninstalled via::\n\n  (py38) $ pip install -r docs/requirements.txt\n\nTo create the docs as HTML in a directory of your choice, then run::\n\n   (py38) $ sphinx-build docs/ mydir/\n\nYou can also change to the ``docs/`` directory and use the prepared\n``Makefile``::\n\n  (py38) $ cd docs/\n  (py38) $ make\n\nThis should generate the docs in ``docs/_build/html/``.\n\n\nCreating the Man Page\n.....................\n\nWe provide a `ReStructuredTexT`_ template to create a man page. When the\ndocumentation engine is installed (`Sphinx`_, see above), then you can create a\nmanpage doing::\n\n  (py38) $ rst2man.py docs/manpage.rst > diceware.1\n\nThe template is mainly provided to ease the job of Debian maintainers.\nCurrently, it is not automatically updated. Dates, authors, synopsis, etc. have\nto be updated manually. Information in the manpage may therefore be wrong,\noutdated, or simply misleading.\n\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nArnold G.
