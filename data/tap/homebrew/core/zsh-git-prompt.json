  "readme": "# Informative git prompt for zsh\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt)\n\nA `zsh` prompt that displays information about the current git repository. In particular the branch name, difference with remote branch, number of files staged, changed, etc.\n\n(an original idea from this [blog post][]).\n\n## Examples\n\nThe prompt may look like the following:\n\n-   `(master↑3|✚1)`: on branch `master`, ahead of remote by 3 commits, 1 file changed but not staged\n-   `(status|●2)`: on branch `status`, 2 files staged\n-   `(master|✚7…)`: on branch `master`, 7 files changed, some files untracked\n-   `(master|✖2✚3)`: on branch `master`, 2 conflicts, 3 files changed\n-   `(experimental↓2↑3|✔)`: on branch `experimental`; your branch has diverged by 3 commits, remote by 2 commits; the repository is otherwise clean\n-   `(:70c2952|✔)`: not on any branch; parent commit has hash `70c2952`;\n    the repository is otherwise clean\n\nHere is how it could look like when you are ahead by 4 commits, behind by 5 commits, and have 1 staged files, 1 changed but unstaged file, and some untracked files, on branch `dev`:\n\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt/raw/master/screenshot.png\" width=300/>\n\n\n## Prompt Structure\n\nBy default, the general appearance of the prompt is:\n\n```\n(<branch><branch tracking>|<local status>)\n```\n\nThe symbols are as follows:\n\n### Local Status Symbols\n\n|Symbol|Meaning\n|------|------|\n|✔ |   repository clean\n|●n |   there are `n` staged files\n|✖n |   there are `n` unmerged files\n|✚n |   there are `n` changed but *unstaged* files\n|… |   there are some untracked files\n\n\n### Branch Tracking Symbols\n\nSymbol | Meaning\n-------|-------\n↑n |   ahead of remote by `n` commits\n↓n |   behind remote by `n` commits\n↓m↑n |   branches diverged, other by `m` commits, yours by `n` commits\n\n### Branch Symbol\n\nWhen the branch name starts with a colon `:`, it means it’s actually a hash, not a branch (although it should be pretty clear, unless you name your branches like hashes :-)\n\n## Install\n\n1.  Clone this repository somewhere on your hard drive.\n2.  Source the file `zshrc.sh` from your `~/.zshrc` config file, and\n    configure your prompt. So, somewhere in `~/.zshrc`, you should have:\n\n    ```sh\n    source path/to/zshrc.sh\n    # an example prompt\n    PROMPT='%B%m%~%b$(git_super_status) %# '\n    ```\n3.  Go in a git repository and test it!\n\n### Haskell (optional)\n\nThere is now a Haskell implementation as well, which can be four to six times faster than the Python one. The reason is not that Haskell is faster in itself (although it is), but that this implementation calls `git` only once. To install, do the following:\n\n1.  Make sure [Haskell's stack](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html#how-to-install) is installed on your system\n2.  `cd` to this folder\n2.  Run `stack setup` to install the Haskell compiler, if it is not already there\n3.  Run `stack build && stack install` (don't worry, the executable is only “installed” in this folder, not on your system)\n4.  Define the variable `GIT_PROMPT_EXECUTABLE=\"haskell\"` somewhere in\n    your `.zshrc`\n\n## Customisation\n\n- You may redefine the function `git_super_status` (after the `source` statement) to adapt it to your needs (to change the order in which the information is displayed).\n- Define the variable `ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_CACHE` in order to enable caching.\n- You may also change a number of variables (which name start with `ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_`) to change the appearance of the prompt.  Take a look in the file `zshrc.sh` to see how the function `git_super_status` is defined, and what variables are available.\n\n**Enjoy!**\n\n  [blog post]: http://sebastiancelis.com/2009/nov/16/zsh-prompt-git-users/\n  "
