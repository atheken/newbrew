This is true for query arguments and for *POST* and *PUT* requests bodies if *application/x-www-form-urlencoded* or *multipart/form-data* header are passed.\n\nAll functions are guaranteed to be completely reentrant and thread-safe (unless differently specified).\nAdditionally, clients can specify resource limits on the overall number of connections, number of connections per IP address and memory used per connection to avoid resource exhaustion.\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## Requirements\nlibhttpserver can be used without any dependencies aside from libmicrohttpd.\n\nThe minimum versions required are:\n* g++ >= 5.5.0 or clang-3.6\n* C++17 or newer\n* libmicrohttpd >= 0.9.64\n* [Optionally]: for TLS (HTTPS) support, you'll need [libgnutls](http://www.gnutls.org/).\n* [Optionally]: to compile the code-reference, you'll need [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/).\n\nAdditionally, for MinGW on windows you will need:\n* libwinpthread (For MinGW-w64, if you use thread model posix then you have this)\n\nFor versions before 0.18.0, on MinGW, you will need:\n* libgnurx >= 2.5.1\n\nFurthermore, the testcases use [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) but you don't need it to compile the library.\n\nPlease refer to the readme file for your particular distribution if there is one for important notes.\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## Building\nlibhttpserver uses the standard system where the usual build process involves running\n> ./bootstrap  \n> mkdir build  \n> cd build  \n> \\.\\./configure  \n> make  \n> make install # (optionally to install on the system)\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\n### Optional parameters to configure script\nA complete list of parameters can be obtained running 'configure --help'.\nHere are listed the libhttpserver specific options (the canonical configure options are also supported).\n\n* _\\-\\-enable-same-directory-build:_ enable to compile in the same directory. This is heavily discouraged. (def=no)\n* _\\-\\-enable-debug:_ enable debug data generation. (def=no)\n* _\\-\\-disable-doxygen-doc:_ don't generate any doxygen documentation. Doxygen is automatically invoked if present on the system. Automatically disabled otherwise.\n* _\\-\\-enable-fastopen:_ enable use of TCP_FASTOPEN (def=yes)\n* _\\-\\-enable-static:_ enable use static linking (def=yes)\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## Getting Started\nThe most basic example of creating a server and handling a requests for the path `/hello`:\n```cpp\n    #include <httpserver.hpp>\n\n    using namespace httpserver;\n\n    class hello_world_resource : public http_resource {\n    public:\n        std::shared_ptr<http_response> render(const http_request&) {\n            return std::shared_ptr<http_response>(new string_response(\"Hello, World!\"));\n        }\n    };\n\n    int main(int argc, char** argv) {\n        webserver ws = create_webserver(8080);\n\n        hello_world_resource hwr;\n        ws.register_resource(\"/hello\", &hwr);\n        ws.start(true);\n        \n        return 0;\n    }\n```\nTo test the above example, you could run the following command from a terminal:\n    \n    curl -XGET -v http://localhost:8080/hello\n\nYou can also check this example on [github](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver/blob/master/examples/minimal_hello_world.cpp).\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## Structures and classes type definition\n* _webserver:_ Represents the daemon listening on a socket for HTTP traffic.\n\t* _create_webserver:_ Builder class to support the creation of a webserver.\n* _http_resource:_ Represents the resource associated with a specific http endpoint.\n* _http_request:_ Represents the request received by the resource that process it.\n* _http_response:_ Represents the response sent by the server once the resource finished its work.\n\t* _string_response:_ A simple string response.\n\t* _file_response:_ A response getting content from a file.\n\t* _basic_auth_fail_response:_ A failure in basic authentication.\n\t* _digest_auth_fail_response:_ A failure in digest authentication.\n\t* _deferred_response:_ A response getting content from a callback.\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## Create and work with a webserver\nAs you can see from the example above, creating a webserver with standard configuration is quite simple:\n```cpp\n    webserver ws = create_webserver(8080);\n```\nThe `create_webserver` class is a supporting _builder_ class that eases the building of a webserver through chained syntax.\n\n### Basic Startup Options\n\nIn this section we will explore other basic options that you can use when configuring your server. More advanced options (custom callbacks, https support, etc...) will be discussed separately.\n\n* _.port(**int** port):_ The port at which the server will listen. This can also be passed to the consturctor of `create_webserver`. E.g. `create_webserver(8080)`.\n* _.max_connections(**int** max_conns):_ Maximum number of concurrent connections to accept. The default is `FD_SETSIZE - 4` (the maximum number of file descriptors supported by `select` minus four for `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr` and the server socket). In other words, the default is as large as possible. Note that if you set a low connection limit, you can easily get into trouble with browsers doing request pipelining.\nFor example, if your connection limit is “1”, a browser may open a first connection to access your “index.html” file, keep it open but use a second connection to retrieve CSS files, images and the like. In fact, modern browsers are typically by default configured for up to 15 parallel connections to a single server. If this happens, the library will refuse to even accept the second connection until the first connection is closed — which does not happen until timeout. As a result, the browser will fail to render the page and seem to hang. If you expect your server to operate close to the connection limit, you should first consider using a lower timeout value and also possibly add a “Connection: close” header to your response to ensure that request pipelining is not used and connections are closed immediately after the request has completed.\n* _.content_size_limit(**size_t** size_limit):_ Sets the maximum size of the content that a client can send over in a single block. The default is `-1 = unlimited`.\n* _.connection_timeout(**int** timeout):_ Determines after how many seconds of inactivity a connection should be timed out automatically. The default timeout is `180 seconds`.\n* _.memory_limit(**int** memory_limit):_ Maximum memory size per connection (followed by a `size_t`). The default is 32 kB (32*1024 bytes). Values above 128k are unlikely to result in much benefit, as half of the memory will be typically used for IO, and TCP buffers are unlikely to support window sizes above 64k on most systems.\n* _.per_IP_connection_limit(**int** connection_limit):_ Limit on the number of (concurrent) connections made to the server from the same IP address. Can be used to prevent one IP from taking over all of the allowed connections. If the same IP tries to establish more than the specified number of connections, they will be immediately rejected. The default is `0`, which means no limit on the number of connections from the same IP address.\n* _.bind_socket(**int** socket_fd):_ Listen socket to use. Pass a listen socket for the daemon to use (systemd-style). If this option is used, the daemon will not open its own listen socket(s). The argument passed must be of type \"int\" and refer to an existing socket that has been bound to a port and is listening.\n* _.max_thread_stack_size(**int** stack_size):_ Maximum stack size for threads created by the library. Not specifying this option or using a value of zero means using the system default (which is likely to differ based on your platform). Default is `0 (system default)`.\n* _.use_ipv6() and .no_ipv6():_ Enable or disable the IPv6 protocol support (by default, libhttpserver will just support IPv4). If you specify this and the local platform does not support it, starting up the server will throw an exception. `off` by default.\n* _.use_dual_stack() and .no_dual_stack():_ Enable or disable the support for both IPv6 and IPv4 protocols at the same time (by default, libhttpserver will just support IPv4). If you specify this and the local platform does not support it, starting up the server will throw an exception. Note that this will mean that IPv4 addresses are returned in the IPv6-mapped format (the ’structsockaddrin6’ format will be used for IPv4 and IPv6). `off` by default.\n* _.pedantic() and .no_pedantic():_ Enables pedantic checks about the protocol (as opposed to as tolerant as possible). Specifically, at the moment, this flag causes the library to reject HTTP 1.1 connections without a `Host` header. This is required by the standard, but of course in violation of the “be as liberal as possible in what you accept” norm. It is recommended to turn this **off** if you are testing clients against the library, and **on** in production. `off` by default.\n* _.debug() and .no_debug():_ Enables debug messages from the library. `off` by default.\n* _.regex_checking() and .no_regex_checking():_ Enables pattern matching for endpoints. Read more [here](#registering-resources). `on` by default.\n* _.post_process() and .no_post_process():_ Enables/Disables the library to automatically parse the body of the http request as arguments if in querystring format. Read more [here](#parsing-requests). `on` by default.\n* _.put_processed_data_to_content() and .no_put_processed_data_to_content():_ Enables/Disables the library to copy parsed body data to the content or to only store it in the arguments map. `on` by default.\n* _.file_upload_target(**file_upload_target_T** file_upload_target):_ Controls, how the library stores uploaded files. Default value is `FILE_UPLOAD_MEMORY_ONLY`.\n\t* `FILE_UPLOAD_MEMORY_ONLY`: The content of the file is only stored in memory. Depending on `put_processed_data_to_content` only as part of the arguments map or additionally in the content.\n\t* `FILE_UPLOAD_DISK_ONLY`: The content of the file is stored only in the file system. The path is created from `file_upload_dir` and either a random name (if `generate_random_filename_on_upload` is true) or the actually uploaded file name.\n\t* `FILE_UPLOAD_MEMORY_AND_DISK`: The content of the file is stored in memory and on the file system.\n* _.file_upload_dir(**const std::string&** file_upload_dir):_ Specifies the directory to store all uploaded files. Default value is `/tmp`.\n* _.generate_random_filename_on_upload() and .no_generate_random_filename_on_upload():_ Enables/Disables the library to generate a unique and unused filename to store the uploaded file to. Otherwise the actually uploaded file name is used. `off` by default.\n* _.deferred()_ and _.no_deferred():_ Enables/Disables the ability for the server to suspend and resume connections. Simply put, it enables/disables the ability to use `deferred_response`. Read more [here](#building-responses-to-requests). `on` by default.\n* _.single_resource() and .no_single_resource:_ Sets or unsets the server in single resource mode. This limits all endpoints to be served from a single resource. The resultant is that the webserver will process the request matching to the endpoint skipping any complex semantic. Because of this, the option is incompatible with `regex_checking` and requires the resource to be registered against an empty endpoint or the root endpoint (`\"/\"`). The resource will also have to be registered as family. (For more information on resource registration, read more [here](#registering-resources)). `off` by default.\n\n### Threading Models\n* _.start_method(**const http::http_utils::start_method_T&** start_method):_ libhttpserver can operate with two different threading models that can be selected through this method. Default value is `INTERNAL_SELECT`.\n\t* `http::http_utils::INTERNAL_SELECT`: In this mode, libhttpserver uses only a single thread to handle listening on the port and processing of requests. This mode is preferable if spawning a thread for each connection would be costly. If the HTTP server is able to quickly produce responses without much computational overhead for each connection, this mode can be a great choice. Note that libhttpserver will still start a single thread for itself -- this way, the main program can continue with its operations after calling the start method. Naturally, if the HTTP server needs to interact with shared state in the main application, synchronization will be required. If such synchronization in code providing a response results in blocking, all HTTP server operations on all connections will stall. This mode is a bad choice if response data cannot always be provided instantly. The reason is that the code generating responses should not block (since that would block all other connections) and on the other hand, if response data is not available immediately, libhttpserver will start to busy wait on it. If you need to scale along the number of concurrent connection and scale on multiple thread you can specify a value for `max_threads` (see below) thus enabling a thread pool - this is different from `THREAD_PER_CONNECTION` below where a new thread is spawned for each connection. \n\t* `http::http_utils::THREAD_PER_CONNECTION`: In this mode, libhttpserver starts one thread to listen on the port for new connections and then spawns a new thread to handle each connection. This mode is great if the HTTP server has hardly any state that is shared between connections (no synchronization issues!) and may need to perform blocking operations (such as extensive IO or running of code) to handle an individual connection.\n* _.max_threads(**int** max_threads):_ A thread pool can be combined with the `INTERNAL_SELECT` mode to benefit implementations that require scalability. As said before, by default this mode only uses a single thread. When combined with the thread pool option, it is possible to handle multiple connections with multiple threads. Any value greater than one for this option will activate the use of the thread pool. In contrast to the `THREAD_PER_CONNECTION` mode (where each thread handles one and only one connection), threads in the pool can handle a large number of concurrent connections. Using `INTERNAL_SELECT` in combination with a thread pool is typically the most scalable (but also hardest to debug) mode of operation for libhttpserver. Default value is `1`. This option is incompatible with `THREAD_PER_CONNECTION`.\n\n### Custom defaulted error messages\nlibhttpserver allows to override internal error retrieving functions to provide custom messages to the HTTP client. There are only 3 cases in which implementing logic (an http_resource) cannot be invoked: (1) a not found resource, where the library is not being able to match the URL requested by the client to any implementing http_resource object; (2) a not allowed method, when the HTTP client is requesting a method explicitly marked as not allowed (more info [here](#allowing-and-disallowing-methods-on-a-resource)) by the implementation; (3) an exception being thrown.\nIn all these 3 cases libhttpserver would provide a standard HTTP response to the client with the correct error code; respectively a `404`, a `405` and a `500`. The library allows its user to specify custom callbacks that will be called to replace the default behavior.\n* _.not_found_resource(**const  shared_ptr<http_response>(&ast;render_ptr)(const http_request&)** resource):_ Specifies a function to handle a request when no matching registered endpoint exist for the URL requested by the client.\n* _.method_not_allowed_resource(**const  shared_ptr<http_response>(&ast;render_ptr)(const http_request&)** resource):_ Specifies a function to handle a request that is asking for a method marked as not allowed on the matching http_resource.\n* _.internal_error_resource(**const  shared_ptr<http_response>(&ast;render_ptr)(const http_request&)** resource):_ Specifies a function to handle a request that is causing an uncaught exception during its execution. **REMEMBER:** is this callback is causing an exception itself, the standard default response from libhttpserver will be reported to the HTTP client.\n\n#### Example of custom errors:\n```cpp\n      #include <httpserver.hpp>\n\n      using namespace httpserver;\n\n      std::shared_ptr<http_response> not_found_custom(const http_request& req) {\n          return std::shared_ptr<string_response>(new string_response(\"Not found custom\", 404, \"text/plain\"));\n      }\n\n      std::shared_ptr<http_response> not_allowed_custom(const http_request& req) {\n          return std::shared_ptr<string_response>(new string_response(\"Not allowed custom\", 405, \"text/plain\"));\n      }\n\n      class hello_world_resource : public http_resource {\n      public:\n          std::shared_ptr<http_response> render(const http_request&) {\n              return std::shared_ptr<http_response>(new string_response(\"Hello, World!\"));\n          }\n      };\n\n      int main(int argc, char** argv) {\n          webserver ws = create_webserver(8080)\n              .not_found_resource(not_found_custom)\n              .method_not_allowed_resource(not_allowed_custom);\n\n          hello_world_resource hwr;\n          hwr.disallow_all();\n          hwr.set_allowing(\"GET\", true);\n          ws.register_resource(\"/hello\", &hwr);\n          ws.start(true);\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n```\nTo test the above example, you can run the following command from a terminal:\n    \n    curl -XGET -v http://localhost:8080/hello\n\nIf you try to run either of the two following commands, you'll see your custom errors:\n* `curl -XGET -v http://localhost:8080/morning`: will return your custom `not found` error.\n* `curl -XPOST -v http://localhost:8080/hello`: will return your custom `not allowed` error.\n\nYou can also check this example on [github](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver/blob/master/examples/custom_error.cpp).\n\n### Custom logging callbacks\n* _.log_access(**void(&ast;log_access_ptr)(const std::string&)** functor):_ Specifies a function used to log accesses (requests) to the server.\n* _.log_error(**void(&ast;log_error_ptr)(const std::string&)** functor):_ Specifies a function used to log errors generating from the server.\n\n#### Example of custom logging callback\n```cpp\n    #include <httpserver.hpp>\n    #include <iostream>\n\n    using namespace httpserver;\n\n    void custom_access_log(const std::string& url) {\n        std::cout << \"ACCESSING: \" << url << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    class hello_world_resource : public http_resource {\n    public:\n        std::shared_ptr<http_response> render(const http_request&) {\n            return std::shared_ptr<http_response>(new string_response(\"Hello, World!\"));\n        }\n    };\n\n    int main(int argc, char** argv) {\n        webserver ws = create_webserver(8080)\n            .log_access(custom_access_log);\n\n        hello_world_resource hwr;\n        ws.register_resource(\"/hello\", &hwr);\n        ws.start(true);\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n```\nTo test the above example, you can run the following command from a terminal:\n    \n    curl -XGET -v http://localhost:8080/hello\n\nYou'll notice how, on the terminal runing your server, the logs will now be printed in output for each request received.\n\nYou can also check this example on [github](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver/blob/master/examples/custom_access_log.cpp).\n\n### TLS/HTTPS\n* _.use_ssl() and .no_ssl():_ Determines whether to run in HTTPS-mode or not. If you set this as on and libhttpserver was compiled without SSL support, the library will throw an exception at start of the server. `off` by default.\n* _.cred_type(**const http::http_utils::cred_type_T&** cred_type):_ Daemon credentials type. Either certificate or anonymous. Acceptable values are:\n\t* `NONE`: No credentials.\n\t* `CERTIFICATE`: Certificate credential.\n\t* `ANON`: Anonymous credential.\n\t* `SRP`: SRP credential.\n\t* `PSK`: PSK credential.\n\t* `IA`: IA credential.\n* _.https_mem_key(**const std::string&** filename):_ String representing the path to a file containing the private key to be used by the HTTPS daemon. This must be used in conjunction with `https_mem_cert`.\n* _.https_mem_cert(**const std::string&** filename):_ String representing the path to a file containing the certificate to be used by the HTTPS daemon. This must be used in conjunction with `https_mem_key`.\n* _.https_mem_trust(**const std::string&** filename):_ String representing the path to a file containing the CA certificate to be used by the HTTPS daemon to authenticate and trust clients certificates. The presence of this option activates the request of certificate to the client. The request to the client is marked optional, and it is the responsibility of the server to check the presence of the certificate if needed. Note that most browsers will only present a client certificate only if they have one matching the specified CA, not sending any certificate otherwise.\n* _.https_priorities(**const std::string&** priority_string):_ SSL/TLS protocol version and ciphers. Must be followed by a string specifying the SSL/TLS protocol versions and ciphers that are acceptable for the application. The string is passed unchanged to gnutls_priority_init. If this option is not specified, `\"NORMAL\"` is used.\n\n#### Minimal example using HTTPS\n```cpp\n    #include <httpserver.hpp>\n\n    using namespace httpserver;\n\n    class hello_world_resource : public http_resource {\n    public:\n        std::shared_ptr<http_response> render(const http_request&) {\n            return std::shared_ptr<http_response>(new string_response(\"Hello, World!\"));\n        }\n    };\n\n    int main(int argc, char** argv) {\n        webserver ws = create_webserver(8080)\n            .use_ssl()\n            .https_mem_key(\"key.pem\")\n            .https_mem_cert(\"cert.pem\");\n\n        hello_world_resource hwr;\n        ws.register_resource(\"/hello\", &hwr);\n        ws.start(true);\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n```\nTo test the above example, you can run the following command from a terminal:\n    \n    curl -XGET -v -k 'https://localhost:8080/hello'\n\nYou can also check this example on [github](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver/blob/master/examples/minimal_https.cpp).\n\n### IP Blacklisting/Whitelisting\nlibhttpserver supports IP blacklisting and whitelisting as an internal feature. This section explains the startup options related with IP blacklisting/whitelisting. See the [specific section](#ip-blacklisting-and-whitelisting) to read more about the topic.\n* _.ban_system() and .no_ban_system:_ Can be used to enable/disable the ban system. `on` by default.\n* _.default_policy(**const http::http_utils::policy_T&** default_policy):_ Specifies what should be the default behavior when receiving a request. Possible values are `ACCEPT` and `REJECT`. Default is `ACCEPT`.\n\n### Authentication Parameters\n* _.basic_auth() and .no_basic_auth:_ Can be used to enable/disable parsing of the basic authorization header sent by the client. `on` by default.\n* _.digest_auth() and .no_digest_auth:_ Can be used to enable/disable parsing of the digested authentication data sent by the client. `on` by default.\n* _.nonce_nc_size(**int** nonce_size):_ Size of an array of nonce and nonce counter map. This option represents the size (number of elements) of a map of a nonce and a nonce-counter. If this option is not specified, a default value of 4 will be used (which might be too small for servers handling many requests).\nYou should calculate the value of NC_SIZE based on the number of connections per second multiplied by your expected session duration plus a factor of about two for hash table collisions. For example, if you expect 100 digest-authenticated connections per second and the average user to stay on your site for 5 minutes, then you likely need a value of about 60000. On the other hand, if you can only expect only 10 digest-authenticated connections per second, tolerate browsers getting a fresh nonce for each request and expect a HTTP request latency of 250 ms, then a value of about 5 should be fine.\n* _.digest_auth_random(**const std::string&** nonce_seed):_ Digest Authentication nonce’s seed. For security, you SHOULD provide a fresh random nonce when actually using Digest Authentication with libhttpserver in production.\n\n### Examples of chaining syntax to create a webserver\n```cpp\n    webserver ws = create_webserver(8080)\n        .no_ssl()\n        .no_ipv6()\n        .no_debug()\n        .no_pedantic()\n        .no_basic_auth()\n        .no_digest_auth()\n        .no_comet()\n        .no_regex_checking()\n        .no_ban_system()\n        .no_post_process();\n```\n##\n```cpp\n    webserver ws = create_webserver(8080)\n        .use_ssl()\n        .https_mem_key(\"key.pem\")\n        .https_mem_cert(\"cert.pem\");\n```\n### Starting and stopping a webserver\nOnce a webserver is created, you can manage its execution through the following methods on the `webserver` class:\n* _**void** webserver::start(**bool** blocking):_ Allows to start a server. If the `blocking` flag is passed as `true`, it will block the execution of the current thread until a call to stop on the same webserver object is performed. \n* _**void** webserver::stop():_ Allows to stop a server. It immediately stops it.\n* _**bool** webserver::is_running():_ Checks if a server is running\n* _**void** webserver::sweet_kill():_ Allows to stop a server. It doesn't guarantee an immediate halt to allow for thread termination and connection closure.\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## The Resource Object\nThe `http_resource` class represents a logical collection of HTTP methods that will be associated to a URL when registered on the webserver. The class is **designed for extension** and it is where most of your code should ideally live. When the webserver matches a request against a resource (see: [resource registration](#registering-resources)), the method correspondent to the one in the request (GET, POST, etc..) (see below) is called on the resource.\n\nGiven this, the `http_resource` class contains the following extensible methods (also called `handlers` or `render methods`):\n* _**std::shared_ptr<http_response>** http_resource::render_GET(**const http_request&** req):_ Invoked on an HTTP GET request.\n* _**std::shared_ptr<http_response>** http_resource::render_POST(**const http_request&** req):_ Invoked on an HTTP POST request.\n* _**std::shared_ptr<http_response>** http_resource::render_PUT(**const http_request&** req):_ Invoked on an HTTP PUT request.\n* _**std::shared_ptr<http_response>** http_resource::render_HEAD(**const http_request&** req):_ Invoked on an HTTP HEAD request.\n* _**std::shared_ptr<http_response>** http_resource::render_DELETE(**const http_request&** req):_ Invoked on an HTTP DELETE request.\n* _**std::shared_ptr<http_response>** http_resource::render_TRACE(**const http_request&** req):_ Invoked on an HTTP TRACE request.\n* _**std::shared_ptr<http_response>** http_resource::render_OPTIONS(**const http_request&** req):_ Invoked on an HTTP OPTIONS request.\n* _**std::shared_ptr<http_response>** http_resource::render_CONNECT(**const http_request&** req):_ Invoked on an HTTP CONNECT request.\n* _**std::shared_ptr<http_response>** http_resource::render(**const http_request&** req):_ Invoked as a backup method if the matching method is not implemented. It can be used whenever you want all the invocations on a URL to activate the same behavior regardless of the HTTP method requested. The default implementation of the `render` method returns an empty response with a `404`.\n\n#### Example of implementation of render methods\n```cpp\n    #include <httpserver.hpp>\n\n    using namespace httpserver;\n\n    class hello_world_resource : public http_resource {\n    public:\n        std::shared_ptr<http_response> render_GET(const http_request&) {\n            return std::shared_ptr<http_response>(new string_response(\"GET: Hello, World!\"));\n        }\n\n        std::shared_ptr<http_response> render(const http_request&) {\n            return std::shared_ptr<http_response>(new string_response(\"OTHER: Hello, World!\"));\n        }\n    };\n\n    int main(int argc, char** argv) {\n        webserver ws = create_webserver(8080);\n\n        hello_world_resource hwr;\n        ws.register_resource(\"/hello\", &hwr);\n        ws.start(true);\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n```\nTo test the above example, you can run the following commands from a terminal:\n * `curl -XGET -v http://localhost:8080/hello`: will return `GET: Hello, World!`.\n * `curl -XPOST -v http://localhost:8080/hello`: will return `OTHER: Hello, World!`. You can try requesting other methods beside `POST` to verify how the same message will be returned.\n\nYou can also check this example on [github](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver/blob/master/examples/handlers.cpp).\n\n### Allowing and disallowing methods on a resource\nBy default, all methods an a resource are allowed, meaning that an HTTP request with that method will be invoked. It is possible to mark methods as `not allowed` on a resource. When a method not allowed is requested on a resource, the default `method_not_allowed` method is invoked - the default can be overriden as explain in the section [Custom defaulted error messages](custom-defaulted-error-messages).\nThe base `http_resource` class has a set of methods that can be used to allow and disallow HTTP methods.\n* _**void**  http_resource::set_allowing(**const std::string&** method, **bool** allowed):_ Used to allow or disallow a method. The `method` parameter is a string representing an HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc...).\n* _**void**  http_resource::allow_all():_ Marks all HTTP methods as allowed.\n* _**void**  http_resource::disallow_all():_ Marks all HTTP methods as not allowed.\n\n#### Example of methods allowed/disallowed\n```cpp\n      #include <httpserver.hpp>\n\n      using namespace httpserver;\n\n      class hello_world_resource : public http_resource {\n      public:\n          std::shared_ptr<http_response> render(const http_request&) {\n              return std::shared_ptr<http_response>(new string_response(\"Hello, World!\"));\n          }\n      };\n\n      int main(int argc, char** argv) {\n          webserver ws = create_webserver(8080);\n\n          hello_world_resource hwr;\n          hwr.disallow_all();\n          hwr.set_allowing(\"GET\", true);\n          ws.register_resource(\"/hello\", &hwr);\n          ws.start(true);\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n```\nTo test the above example, you can run the following command from a terminal:\n    \n    curl -XGET -v http://localhost:8080/hello\n\nIf you try to run the following command, you'll see a `method_not_allowed` error:\n* `curl -XPOST -v http://localhost:8080/hello`.\n\nYou can also check this example on [github](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver/blob/master/examples/allowing_disallowing_methods.cpp).\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## Registering resources\nOnce you have created your resource and extended its methods, you'll have to register the resource on the webserver. Registering a resource will associate it with an endpoint and allows the webserver to route it.\nThe `webserver` class offers a method to register a resource:\n* _**bool** register_resource(**const std::string&** endpoint, **http_resource&ast;** resource, **bool** family = `false`):_ Registers the `resource` to an `endpoint`. The endpoint is a string representing the path on your webserver from where you want your resource to be served from (e.g. `\"/path/to/resource\"`). The optional `family` parameter allows to register a resource as a \"family\" resource that will match any path nested into the one specified. For example, if family is set to `true` and endpoint is set to `\"/path\"`, the webserver will route to the resource not only the requests against  `\"/path\"` but also everything in its nested path `\"/path/on/the/previous/one\"`.\n\n### Specifying endpoints\nThere are essentially four ways to specify an endpoint string:\n* **A simple path (e.g. `\"/path/to/resource\"`).** In this case, the webserver will try to match exactly the value of the endpoint.\n* **A regular exception.** In this case, the webserver will try to match the URL of the request with the regex passed. For example, if passing `\"/path/as/decimal/[0-9]+`, requests on URLs like `\"/path/as/decimal/5\"` or `\"/path/as/decimal/42\"` will be matched; instead, URLs like `\"/path/as/decimal/three\"` will not.\n* **A parametrized path. (e.g. `\"/path/to/resource/with/{arg1}/{arg2}/in/url\"`)**. In this case, the webserver will match the argument with any value passed. In addition to this, the arguments will be passed to the resource as part of the arguments (readable from the `http_request::get_arg` method - see [here](#parsing-requests)). For example, if passing `\"/path/to/resource/with/{arg1}/{arg2}/in/url\"` will match any request on URL with any value in place of `{arg1}` and `{arg2}`. \n* **A parametrized path with custom parameters.** This is the same of a normal parametrized path, but allows to specify a regular expression for the argument (e.g. `\"/path/to/resource/with/{arg1|[0-9]+}/{arg2|[a-z]+}/in/url\"`. In this case, the webserver will match the arguments with any value passed that satisfies the regex. In addition to this, as above, the arguments will be passed to the resource as part of the arguments (readable from the `http_request::get_arg` method - see [here](#parsing-requests)). For example, if passing `\"/path/to/resource/with/{arg1|[0-9]+}/{arg2|[a-z]+}/in/url\"` will match requests on URLs like `\"/path/to/resource/with/10/AA/in/url\"` but not like `\"\"/path/to/resource/with/BB/10/in/url\"\"`\n* Any of the above marked as `family`. Will match any request on URLs having path that is prefixed by the path passed. For example, if family is set to `true` and endpoint is set to `\"/path\"`, the webserver will route to the resource not only the requests against  `\"/path\"` but also everything in its nested path `\"/path/on/the/previous/one\"`.\n```cpp\n      #include <httpserver.hpp>\n\n      using namespace httpserver;\n\n      class hello_world_resource : public http_resource {\n      public:\n          std::shared_ptr<http_response> render(const http_request&) {\n              return std::shared_ptr<http_response>(new string_response(\"Hello, World!\"));\n          }\n      };\n\n      class handling_multiple_resource : public http_resource {\n      public:\n          std::shared_ptr<http_response> render(const http_request& req) {\n              return std::shared_ptr<http_response>(new string_response(\"Your URL: \" + req.get_path()));\n          }\n      };\n\n      class url_args_resource : public http_resource {\n      public:\n          std::shared_ptr<http_response> render(const http_request& req) {\n              std::string arg1(req.get_arg(\"arg1\"));\n              std::string arg2(req.get_arg(\"arg2\"));\n              return std::shared_ptr<http_response>(new string_response(\"ARGS: \" + arg1 + \" and \" + arg2));\n          }\n      };\n\n      int main(int argc, char** argv) {\n          webserver ws = create_webserver(8080);\n\n          hello_world_resource hwr;\n          ws.register_resource(\"/hello\", &hwr);\n\n          handling_multiple_resource hmr;\n          ws.register_resource(\"/family\", &hmr, true);\n          ws.register_resource(\"/with_regex_[0-9]+\", &hmr);\n\n          url_args_resource uar;\n          ws.register_resource(\"/url/with/{arg1}/and/{arg2}\", &uar);\n          ws.register_resource(\"/url/with/parametric/args/{arg1|[0-9]+}/and/{arg2|[A-Z]+}\", &uar);\n\n          ws.start(true);\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n```\nTo test the above example, you can run the following commands from a terminal:\n    \n* `curl -XGET -v http://localhost:8080/hello`: will return the `Hello, World!` message.\n* `curl -XGET -v http://localhost:8080/family`: will return the `Your URL: /family` message.\n* `curl -XGET -v http://localhost:8080/family/with/suffix`: will return the `Your URL: /family/with/suffix` message.\n* `curl -XGET -v http://localhost:8080/with_regex_10`: will return the `Your URL: /with_regex_10` message.\n* `curl -XGET -v http://localhost:8080/url/with/AA/and/BB`: will return the `ARGS: AA and BB` message. You can change `AA` and `BB` with any value and observe how the URL is still matched and parameters are read.\n* `curl -XGET -v http://localhost:8080/url/with/parametric/args/10/and/AA`: will return the `ARGS: 10 and AA` message. You can change `10` and `AA` with any value matching the regexes and observe how the URL is still matched and parameters are read.\n\nConversely, you can observe how these URL will not be matched (al the following will give you a `not found` message):\n* `curl -XGET -v http://localhost:8080/with_regex_A`\n* `curl -XGET -v http://localhost:8080/url/with/parametric/args/AA/and/BB`\n\nYou can also check this example on [github](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver/blob/master/examples/url_registration.cpp).\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## Parsing requests\nAs seen in the documentation of [http_resource](#the-resource-object), every extensible method takes in input a `http_request` object. The webserver takes the responsibility to extract the data from the HTTP request on the network and does all the heavy lifting to build the instance of `http_request`.\n\nThe `http_request` class has a set of methods you will have access to when implementing your handlers:\n* _**const std::string&** get_path() **const**:_ Returns the path as requested from the HTTP client.\n* _**const std::vector\\<std::string\\>&** get_path_pieces() **const**:_ Returns the components of the path requested by the HTTP client (each piece of the path split by `'/'`.\n* _**const std::string&** get_path_piece(int index) **const**:_ Returns one piece of the path requested by the HTTP client. The piece is selected through the `index` parameter (0-indexed). \n* _**const std::string&** get_method() **const**:_ Returns the method requested by the HTTP client.\n* _**std::string_view** get_header(**std::string_view** key) **const**:_ Returns the header with name equal to `key` if present in the HTTP request. Returns an `empty string` otherwise.\n* _**std::string_view** get_cookie(**std::string_view** key) **const**:_ Returns the cookie with name equal to `key` if present in the HTTP request. Returns an `empty string` otherwise.\n* _**std::string_view** get_footer(**std::string_view** key) **const**:_ Returns the footer with name equal to `key` if present in the HTTP request (only for http 1.1 chunked encodings). Returns an `empty string` otherwise.\n* _**http_arg_value** get_arg(**std::string_view** key) **const**:_ Returns the argument with name equal to `key` if present in the HTTP request. Arguments can be (1) querystring parameters, (2) path argument (in case of parametric endpoint, (3) parameters parsed from the HTTP request body if the body is in `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data` formats and the postprocessor is enabled in the webserver (enabled by default).

Given that the body post processing is enabled, you can also run `curl -d \"name=John\" -X POST http://localhost:8080/hello` to obtain the same result.\n\nYou can also check this example on [github](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver/blob/master/examples/hello_with_get_arg.cpp).\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## Building responses to requests\nAs seen in the documentation of [http_resource](#the-resource-object), every extensible method returns in output a `http_response` object. The webserver takes the responsibility to convert the `http_response` object you create into a response on the network.\n\nThere are 5 types of response that you can create - we will describe them here through their constructors:\n* _string_response(**const std::string&** content, **int** response_code = `200`, **const std::string&** content_type = `\"text/plain\"`):_ The most basic type of response. It uses the `content` string passed in construction as body of the HTTP response. The other two optional parameters are the `response_code` and the `content_type`. You can find constant definition for the various response codes within the [http_utils](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver/blob/master/src/httpserver/http_utils.hpp) library file.\n* _file_response(**const std::string&** filename, **int** response_code = `200`, **const std::string&** content_type = `\"text/plain\"`):_ Uses the `filename` passed in construction as pointer to a file on disk. The body of the HTTP response will be set using the content of the file. The file must be a regular file and exist on disk. Otherwise libhttpserver will return an error 500 (Internal Server Error). The other two optional parameters are the `response_code` and the `content_type`. You can find constant definition for the various response codes within the [http_utils](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver/blob/master/src/httpserver/http_utils.hpp) library file.\n* _basic_auth_fail_response(**const std::string&** content, **const std::string&** realm = `\"\"`, **int** response_code = `200`, **const std::string&** content_type = `\"text/plain\"`):_ A response in return to a failure during basic authentication. It allows to specify a `content` string as a message to send back to the client. The `realm` parameter should contain your realm of authentication (if any). The other two optional parameters are the `response_code` and the `content_type`. You can find constant definition for the various response codes within the [http_utils](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver/blob/master/src/httpserver/http_utils.hpp) library file.\n* _digest_auth_fail_response(**const std::string&** content, **const std::string&** realm = `\"\"`, **const std::string&** opaque = `\"\"`, **bool** reload_nonce = `false`, **int** response_code = `200`, **const std::string&** content_type = `\"text/plain\"`):_ A response in return to a failure during digest authentication. It allows to specify a `content` string as a message to send back to the client. The `realm` parameter should contain your realm of authentication (if any). The `opaque` represents a value that gets passed to the client and expected to be passed again to the server as-is. This value can be a hexadecimal or base64 string. The `reload_nonce` parameter tells the server to reload the nonce (you should use the value returned by the `check_digest_auth` method on the `http_request`. The other two optional parameters are the `response_code` and the `content_type`. You can find constant definition for the various response codes within the [http_utils](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver/blob/master/src/httpserver/http_utils.hpp) library file.\n* _deferred_response(**ssize_t(&ast;cycle_callback_ptr)(shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;, char&ast;, size_t)** cycle_callback, **const std::string&** content = `\"\"`, **int** response_code = `200`, **const std::string&** content_type = `\"text/plain\"`):_ A response that obtains additional content from a callback executed in a deferred way. It leaves the client in pending state (returning a `100 CONTINUE` message) and suspends the connection. Besides the callback, optionally, you can provide a `content` parameter that sets the initial message sent immediately to the client. The other two optional parameters are the `response_code` and the `content_type`. You can find constant definition for the various response codes within the [http_utils](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver/blob/master/src/httpserver/http_utils.hpp) library file. To use `deferred_response` you need to have the `deferred` option active on your webserver (enabled by default).\n\t* The `cycle_callback_ptr` has this shape:\n\t\t_**ssize_t** cycle_callback(**shared_ptr&lt;T&gt; closure_data, char&ast;** buf, **size_t** max_size)_.\n\t\tYou are supposed to implement a function in this shape and provide it to the `deferred_repsonse` method. The webserver will provide a `char*` to the function. It is responsibility of the function to allocate it and fill its content. The method is supposed to respect the `max_size` parameter passed in input. The function must return  a `ssize_t` value representing the actual size you filled the `buf` with. Any value different from `-1` will keep the resume the connection, deliver the content and suspend it again (with a `100 CONTINUE`). If the method returns `-1`, the webserver will complete the communication with the client and close the connection. You can also pass a `shared_ptr` pointing to a data object of your choice (this will be templetized with a class of your choice). The server will guarantee that this object is passed at each invocation of the method allowing the client code to use it as a memory buffer during computation.\n\n### Setting additional properties of the response\nThe `http_response` class offers an additional set of methods to \"decorate\" your responses. This set of methods is:\n* _**void**  with_header(**const std::string&** key, **const std::string&** value):_ Sets an HTTP header with name set to `key` and value set to `value`.\n* _**void**  with_footer(**const std::string&** key, **const std::string&** value):_ Sets an HTTP footer with name set to `key` and value set to `value`.\n* _**void**  with_cookie(**const std::string&** key, **const std::string&** value):_ Sets an HTTP cookie with name set to `key` and value set to `value` (only for http 1.1 chunked encodings). \n* _**void**  shoutCAST():_ Mark the response as a `shoutCAST` one.\n\n### Example of response setting headers\n```cpp\n    #include <httpserver.hpp>\n\n    using namespace httpserver;\n\n    class hello_world_resource : public http_resource {\n    public:\n        std::shared_ptr<http_response> render(const http_request&) {\n            std::shared_ptr<http_response> response = std::shared_ptr<http_response>(new string_response(\"Hello, World!\"));\n            response->with_header(\"MyHeader\", \"MyValue\");\n            return response;\n        }\n    };\n\n    int main(int argc, char** argv) {\n        webserver ws = create_webserver(8080);\n\n        hello_world_resource hwr;\n        ws.register_resource(\"/hello\", &hwr);\n        ws.start(true);\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n```\nTo test the above example, you could run the following command from a terminal:\n    \n    curl -XGET -v \"http://localhost:8080/hello\"\n\nYou will receive the message custom header in reply.\n\nYou can also check this example on [github](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver/blob/master/examples/setting_headers.cpp).\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## IP Blacklisting and Whitelisting\nlibhttpserver provides natively a system to blacklist and whitelist IP addresses. To enable/disable the system, it is possible to use the `ban_system` and `no_ban_system` methods on the `create_webserver` class. In the same way, you can specify what you want to be your \"default behavior\" (allow by default or disallow by default) by using the `default_policy` method (see [here](#create-and-work-with-a-webserver)).\n\nThe system supports both IPV4 and IPV6 and manages them transparently. The only requirement is for ipv6 to be enabled on your server - you'll have to enable this by using the `use_ipv6` method on `create_webserver`.\n\nYou can explicitly ban or allow an IP address using the following methods on the `webserver` class:\n* _**void** ban_ip(**const std::string&** ip):_ Adds one IP (or a range of IPs) to the list of the banned ones. Takes in input a `string` that contains the IP (or range of IPs) to ban. To use when the `default_policy` is `ACCEPT`.\n* _**void** allow_ip(**const std::string&** ip):_ Adds one IP (or a range of IPs) to the list of the allowed ones. Takes in input a `string` that contains the IP (or range of IPs) to allow.  To use when the `default_policy` is `REJECT`.\n* _**void** unban_ip(**const std::string&** ip):_ Removes one IP (or a range of IPs) from the list of the banned ones. Takes in input a `string` that contains the IP (or range of IPs) to remove from the list.  To use when the `default_policy` is `ACCEPT`.\n* _**void** disallow_ip(**const std::string&** ip):_ Removes one IP (or a range of IPs) from the list of the allowed ones. Takes in input a `string` that contains the IP (or range of IPs) to remove from the list.  To use when the `default_policy` is `REJECT`.\n\n### IP String Format\nThe IP string format can represent both IPV4 and IPV6. Addresses will be normalized by the webserver to operate in the same sapce. Any valid IPV4 or IPV6 textual representation works.\nIt is also possible to specify ranges of IPs. To do so, omit the octect you want to express as a range and specify a `'*'` in its place.\nExamples of valid IPs include:\n* `\"192.168.5.5\"`: standard IPV4\n* `\"192.168.*.*\"`: range of IPV4 addresses. In the example, everything between `192.168.0.0` and `192.168.255.255`.\n* `\"2001:db8:8714:3a90::12\"`: standard IPV6 - clustered empty ranges are fully supported.\n* `\"2001:db8:8714:3a90:*:*\"`: range of IPV6 addresses.\n* `\"::ffff:192.0.2.128\"`: IPV4 IPs nested into IPV6.\n* `\"::192.0.2.128\"`: IPV4 IPs nested into IPV6 (without `'ffff'` prefix)\n* `\"::ffff:192.0.*.*\"`: ranges of IPV4 IPs nested into IPV6.\n\n#### Example of IP Whitelisting/Blacklisting\n```cpp\n    #include <httpserver.hpp>\n\n    using namespace httpserver;\n\n    class hello_world_resource : public http_resource {\n    public:\n        std::shared_ptr<http_response> render(const http_request&) {\n            return std::shared_ptr<http_response>(new string_response(\"Hello, World!\"));\n        }\n    };\n\n    int main(int argc, char** argv) {\n        webserver ws = create_webserver(8080)\n            .default_policy(http::http_utils::REJECT);\n\n        ws.allow_ip(\"127.0.0.1\");\n\n        hello_world_resource hwr;\n        ws.register_resource(\"/hello\", &hwr);\n        ws.start(true);\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n```\nTo test the above example, you could run the following command from a terminal:\n    \n    curl -XGET -v \"http://localhost:8080/hello\"\n\nYou can also check this example on [github](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver/blob/master/examples/minimal_ip_ban.cpp).\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## Authentication\nlibhttpserver support three types of client authentication.\n\nBasic authentication uses a simple authentication method based on BASE64 algorithm. Username and password are exchanged in clear between the client and the server, so this method must only be used for non-sensitive content or when the session is protected with https. When using basic authentication libhttpserver will have access to the clear password, possibly allowing to create a chained authentication toward an external authentication server. You can enable/disable support for Basic authentication through the `basic_auth` and `no_basic_auth` methods of the `create_webserver` class.\n\nDigest authentication uses a one-way authentication method based on MD5 hash algorithm. Only the hash will transit over the network, hence protecting the user password. The nonce will prevent replay attacks. This method is appropriate for general use, especially when https is not used to encrypt the session. You can enable/disable support for Digest authentication through the `digest_auth` and `no_digest_auth` methods of the `create_webserver` class.\n\nClient certificate authentication uses a X.509 certificate from the client. This is the strongest authentication mechanism but it requires the use of HTTPS. Client certificate authentication can be used simultaneously with Basic or Digest Authentication in order to provide a two levels authentication (like for instance separate machine and user authentication). You can enable/disable support for Certificate authentication through the `use_ssl` and `no_ssl` methods of the `create_webserver` class.\n\n### Using Basic Authentication\n```cpp\n    #include <httpserver.hpp>\n\n    using namespace httpserver;\n\n    class user_pass_resource : public httpserver::http_resource {\n    public:\n        std::shared_ptr<http_response> render_GET(const http_request& req) {\n            if (req.get_user() != \"myuser\" || req.get_pass() != \"mypass\") {\n                return std::shared_ptr<basic_auth_fail_response>(new basic_auth_fail_response(\"FAIL\", \"test@example.com\"));\n            }\n            return std::shared_ptr<string_response>(new string_response(req.get_user() + \" \" + req.get_pass(), 200, \"text/plain\"));\n        }\n    };\n\n    int main(int argc, char** argv) {\n        webserver ws = create_webserver(8080);\n\n        user_pass_resource hwr;\n        ws.register_resource(\"/hello\", &hwr);\n        ws.start(true);\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n```\nTo test the above example, you can run the following command from a terminal:\n    \n    curl -XGET -v -u myuser:mypass \"http://localhost:8080/hello\"\n\nYou will receive back the user and password you passed in input.

It also counts\nas the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\nthe version number 2.1._\n\n### Preamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\nWe call this license the &ldquo;Lesser&rdquo; General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n&ldquo;work based on the library&rdquo; and a &ldquo;work that uses the library&rdquo;.  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\n### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n**0.** This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called &ldquo;this License&rdquo;).\nEach licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.\n\nA &ldquo;library&rdquo; means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe &ldquo;Library&rdquo;, below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A &ldquo;work based on the\nLibrary&rdquo; means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term &ldquo;modification&rdquo;.)\n\n&ldquo;Source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n**1.** You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n**2.** You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n* **a)** The modified work must itself be a software library.\n* **b)** You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n* **c)** You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\ncharge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n* **d)** If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\ntable of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\nthe facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\nis invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\nin the event an application does not supply such function or\ntable, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\nits purpose remains meaningful.  \n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\na purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\napplication.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\napplication-supplied function or table used by this function must\nbe optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\nroot function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n**3.** You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n**4.** You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n**5.** A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo;.  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\nHowever, linking a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo; with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a &ldquo;work that uses the\nlibrary&rdquo;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\nWhen a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo; uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n**6.** As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo; with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n* **a)** Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\nmachine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\nchanges were used in the work (which must be distributed under\nSections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\nwith the Library, with the complete machine-readable &ldquo;work that\nuses the Library&rdquo;, as object code and/or source code, so that the\nuser can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\nexecutable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\nthat the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\nLibrary will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\nto use the modified definitions.)\n* **b)** Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\nLibrary.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\ncopy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\nrather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\nwill operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\nthe user installs one, as long as the modified version is\ninterface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n* **c)** Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\nleast three years, to give the same user the materials\nspecified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\nthan the cost of performing this distribution.\n* **d)** If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\nspecified materials from the same place.\n* **e)** Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\nmaterials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\nFor an executable, the required form of the &ldquo;work that uses the\nLibrary&rdquo; must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n**7.** You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n* **a)** Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\nbased on the Library, uncombined with any other library\nfacilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\nSections above.\n* **b)** Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\nthat part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\nwhere to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n**8.** You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n**9.** You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n**10.** Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\n**11.** If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n**12.** If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n**13.** The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n&ldquo;any later version&rdquo;, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n**14.** If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n### NO WARRANTY\n\n**15.** BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n**16.** IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n&ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

PREAMBLE\n\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional and useful document &ldquo;free&rdquo; in the sense of freedom: to\nassure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\nwith or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\nSecondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\nfor modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n\n### 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\nwork under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,\nrefers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\nlicensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you\ncopy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\nunder copyright law.\n\nA &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nA &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\nthe Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall\nsubject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall\ndirectly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in\npart a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain\nany mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\nthem.\n\nThe &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\nsection does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\nallowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\nInvariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\nSections then there are none.\n\nThe &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\nbe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\nA &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\ngeneral public, that is suitable for revising the document\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\nto text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\nformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\nor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\nAn image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\nof text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\nor XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\nHTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\ntransparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\ninclude proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\nproprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the\nmachine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\nprocessors for output purposes only.\n\nThe &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\nThe &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies of\nthe Document to the public.\n\nA section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose\ntitle either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\ntext that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\nspecific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,\n&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;\nof such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\nsection &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\nstates that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\nDisclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\nLicense, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\nimplication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\nno effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n### 2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no\nother conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n\n\n### 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\nprinted covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\ncopies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\nthe back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\nyou as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\nthe full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\nthe title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\nas verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\na computer-network location from which the general network-using\npublic has access to download using public-standard network protocols\na complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\nIf you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\nwhen you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\nthat this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\nlocation until at least one year after the last time you distribute an\nOpaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\nedition to the public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to\ngive them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the\nDocument.\n\n\n### 4. MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\nthe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\nVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\nand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\n* **A.** Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\nfrom that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\nof the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\nif the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n* **B.** List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\nresponsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\nVersion, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\nDocument (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\nunless they release you from this requirement.\n* **C.** State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\nModified Version, as the publisher.\n* **D.** Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n* **E.** Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\nadjacent to the other copyright notices.\n* **F.** Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\ngiving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\nterms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n* **G.** Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\nand required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\n* **H.** Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n* **I.** Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add\nto it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\npublisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\nthere is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one\nstating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\ngiven on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\nVersion as stated in the previous sentence.\n* **J.** Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\npublic access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\nthe network locations given in the Document for previous versions\nit was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section.\nYou may omit a network location for a work that was published at\nleast four years before the Document itself, or if the original\npublisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n* **K.** For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;,\nPreserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all\nthe substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\nand/or dedications given therein.\n* **L.** Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\nunaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\nor the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n* **M.** Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section\nmay not be included in the Modified Version.\n* **N.** Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;\nor to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n* **O.** Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\nappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\ncopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\nof these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains\nnothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\nparties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\nstandard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\nof Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\nthrough arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n\n### 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\nlicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\nauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;\nin the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\n&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,\nand any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all sections\nEntitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.\n\n\n### 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other\ndocuments released under this License, and replace the individual\ncopies of this License in the various documents with a single copy\nthat is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules\nof this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all\nother respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and\ndistribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a\ncopy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this\nLicense in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that\ndocument.\n\n\n### 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright\nresulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\nof the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.\nWhen the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not\napply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\nderivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\nthe entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\ncovers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\nOtherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\naggregate.\n\n\n### 8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the\nDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\nthe original English version of this License and the original versions\nof those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\nthe translation and the original version of this License or a notice\nor disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,\n&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\nits Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\ntitle.\n\n\n### 9. TERMINATION\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\nunless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\nterminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\nfails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to\n60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does\nnot give you any rights to use it.\n\n\n### 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the\nGNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\ndetail to address new problems or concerns.  See\n&lt;<http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>&gt;.\n\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\nIf the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\nLicense &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\nof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\nFree Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\nas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document\nspecifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this\nLicense can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a\nversion permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the\nDocument.\n\n### 11. RELICENSING\n\n&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any\nWorld Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also\nprovides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A\npublic wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A\n&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the site\nmeans any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\n\n&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 \nlicense published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit \ncorporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, \nCalifornia, as well as future copyleft versions of that license \npublished by that same organization.\n\n&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in \npart, as part of another Document.\n\nAn MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this \nLicense, and if all works that were first published under this License \nsomewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or \nin part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and \n(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\n\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site\nunder CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,\nprovided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.\n\n\n## ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\nthe License in the document and put the following copyright and\nlicense notices just after the title page:\n\n    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\n    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3\n    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\n    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &ldquo;GNU\n    Free Documentation License&rdquo;.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\nreplace the `with...Texts.` line with this:\n\n    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\n    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\nsituation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\nrecommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\nfree software license, such as the GNU General Public License,\nto permit their use in free software.\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## Thanks\n\nThis library has been originally developed under the zencoders flags and this community has always supported me all along this work so I am happy to put the logo on this readme.\n\n              When you see this tree, know that you've came across ZenCoders\n    \n                                   with open('ZenCoders.                            \n                             `num` in numbers   synchronized                        \n                         datetime d      glob.     sys.argv[2] .                    \n                      def myclass   `..` @@oscla   org.   .  class {                \n                   displ  hooks(   public static void   ma    functor:              \n                 $myclass->method(  impport sys, os.pipe `   @param name`           \n               fcl   if(system(cmd) myc. /de   `  $card( array(\"a\"   srand          \n             format  lists:  ++:   conc   ++ \"my  an   WHERE  for(   == myi         \n           `sys:  myvalue(myvalue) sys.t   Console.W  try{    rais     using        \n          connec  SELECT * FROM table mycnf acco desc and or selector::clas  at     \n         openldap string  sys.   print \"zenc der \" { 'a':  `ls -l` >  appe &firs    \n        import Tkinter    paste( $obh  &a or it myval  bro roll:  :: [] require a   \n       case `` super. +y  <svg x=\"100\">  expr    say \" %rooms 1  --account fb- yy   \n      proc    meth Animate => send(D, open)    putd    EndIf 10  whi   myc`   cont  \n     and    main (--) import loop $$ or  end onload  UNION WITH tab   timer 150 *2  \n     end. begin True GtkLabel *label    doto partition te   let auto  i<- (i + d );
