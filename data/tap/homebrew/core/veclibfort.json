See the section [Preloaded (interposing) library](#preloaded) \n    for more details on how you may be able to fix these programs without\n    recompilation.\n\n<a name=\"background\"></a>\n### Background\n\n[Apple's vecLib framework][vecLib] provides both C and FORTRAN bindings for\nBLAS and LAPACK, the de-facto standard libraries for dense numerical linear\nalgebra. Because there remains quite a bit of useful FORTRAN code out there\nthat in turn depend on BLAS and LAPACK, this is certainly a welcome provision\nfrom Apple.\n\nUnfortunately, those FORTRAN bindings follow an [F2C][]-style return value\nconvention, while [GNU Fortran][] uses a [different convention][gnufarg]. Most\nsubroutines and functions work without modification; in particular, if you \nrely solely on double-precision *real* arithmetic, you are fine. For single\nprecision or complex arithmetic, there are two fatal incompatibilities:\n\n* Functions whose FORTRAN specifications call for returning single-precision\n  real values, such as ``sdot_`` and ``snrm2_``, actually return \n  *double-precision* results in the Apple/F2C calling convention. GNU Fortran, \n  on the other hand, expects to receive the single-precision result.\n* Functions designed to return complex values, whether single-precision or\n  double-precision, are converted to subroutines in the Apple/F2C convention, \n  with a pointer to the return value serving as the first argument. (Note that\n  this differs from the CBLAS convention of passing a pointer to the\n  return value as the *final* argument.) GNU Fortran, on the other hand,\n  expects these values to be returned as a C-style return value.\n\nFor programs that use single-precision or complex arithmetic, then, these\nincompatibilities *must* be addressed or incorrect results and crashes can\noccur. In some projects, these errors go uncorrected, because the use cases\nthat exercise them are uncommon.\n\nOne solution is to force GNU Fortran to adopt the older, F2C-style return\nvalue convention, using the ``-ff2c`` flag. If that solution is sufficient\nfor you, then I encourage you to adopt it. Unfortunately, this may not be\npossible if there is other code or other libraries that you rely upon that\nassume the default GNU Fortran convention. And don't forget to rewrite your\nC code according to the F2C return value conventions.\n\nThe approach taken by vecLibFort is to provide a thin translation layer\nbetween the F2C and GFortran worlds, for the few functions where there is a\ndifference. For BLAS, this is simply a matter of wrapping Apple's CBLAS\ncalls in a FORTRAN-friendly wrapper. For LAPACK, a bit of dlopen/dlsym\ntrickery is required to avoid name conflicts.\n\nStill another option is to use a different BLAS and LAPACK library, such\nas [MKL][] or [OpenBlas][]. I am sure there are good arguments to be made\nfor all three options.\n\n### Using vecLibFort\n\nThis code can be used in one of three ways, and the included ``Makefile``\nbuilds all three for you. The only variable you may want to modify is the\n``PREFIX`` variable, which determines the install location ``$(PREFIX)/lib``.\n\n#### Dynamic library: ``libvecLibFort.dylib``\n\nThe most straightforward way to use ``vecLibFort`` is by linking with the \nstandard dynamic library using ``-lvecLibFort``. Of course, if you installed\nthe library in a non-standard location, you will need an ``-L<path>`` linker\nflag as well.\n\nIf you use this apporach, you do *not* need to add ``-framework vecLib`` or\n``-framework Accelerate`` as well. That is because vecLibFort is built to \nre-export all of Accelerate's symbols, even those it does not \"fix\". Thus it \nserves as a *full replacement* for vecLib/Accelerate.\n\n#### Static library / direct inclusion: ``libvecLibFort.a``\n\nFor new projects, feel free to add ``vecLibFort.c``, ``static.h``, and\n``cloak.h`` to your project, or link with the static library. You will also\nneed to link ``-framework vecLib`` or ``-framework Accelerate``.\n\n<a name=\"preloaded\"></a>\n#### Preloaded (interposing) library: ``libvecLibFortI.dylib``\n\nSuppose you have a program that is already compiled, but which apparently \nexhibits the errors discussed herein. Or perhaps you are using a precompiled\nthird-party library that has not implemented measures like these itself; but\nbecause it has already been linked to vecLib, the bugs are baked in. (If you \ncan alter the linking information of a dynamic library, I bow to your skill.)\n\nIn these cases, there is a *preload* feature of Mac OSX's ``dyld`` system that\ncan come in quite handy. The OS makes it possible to specify a library to be\n*preloaded* before the application, with a list of instructions to replace\nfunctions with alternate versions, a process known as *interposing*. The\nsource file ``vecLibFort.c`` includes this interposing code, but it is\nwrapped with ``#ifdef VECLIBFORT_INTERPOSE`` to avoid clashing with the \nnon-interposing code.\n\nTo use this library, you must add the full path to ``libvecLibFortI.dylib``\nto the [``DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`` environment variable][DYLD]. For instance,\nif it has been installed in the default location, the command\n\n    DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/local/lib/libvecLibFortI.dylib program\n\nwill run the program ``program`` but with the BLAS and LAPACK calls corrected.\n\nOf course, this may not work---it may be that the bugs you are seeing are not\nin fact caused by the specific issues addressed by vecLibFort. Or I might not\nhave implemented something correctly. (Bug reports are welcome.) And you\nshould *not* use this if the program or library *already* uses the F2C \ncalling conventions correctly; you *will* break it.\n\n### Inspirations\n\nThis code in ``vecLibFort.c`` is new, but the concepts that undergird it are \nmost certainly not. The inspirations include:\n\n* The [dotwrp project][dotwrp] project provides a simple FORTRAN-based wrapper\n  for the 5 most common problematic BLAS functions. Thanks to vecLib's CBLAS \n  interface, the substitutions can be made statically. We have extended this \n  approach to cover all of the relevant BLAS calls, and implemented it in C.\n* The dynamic substitution approach is heavily inspired by the method used by\n  [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), as contributed by Jarno\n  Rajahaime. You can see the [here][blaswrap]. vecLibFort differs from Octave\n  in that it resolves the replacements lazily, eliminating the need for\n  lookup tables and (hopefully) improving performance. It also implements the \n  full set of BLAS/LAPACK replacements, whereas Octave replaces only a subset.\n* The interposing implementation is explained in a variety of places on the \n  Internet, including section 2.6.3.4 of Amit Singh's book \"Mac OSX\n  Internals.\" (http://osxbook.com). Point your favorite search engine to the\n  term [``DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES``][Google] to find a wealth of material.\n* In order to make the primary source file as compact as possible, this code\n  employs a simple preprocessor library by Paul Fultz II called [Cloak][]. The\n  [Boost Preprocessor Library][Boost] is perhaps a more well known example\n  of this kind of work, but it is far more complex than needed in this case.\n\n### License\n\n##### English\n\nI've released this under the [Boost Software License][boost].
